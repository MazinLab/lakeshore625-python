LIMITED WARRANTY STATEMENT
WARRANTY PERIOD: THREE (3) YEARS
1.

Lake Shore warrants that products manufactured by Lake Shore (the "Product") will be free from defects in materials and
workmanship for three years from the date of Purchaser's physical receipt of the Product (the "Warranty Period"). If Lake Shore
receives notice of any such defects during the Warranty Period and the defective Product is shipped freight prepaid back to Lake
Shore, Lake Shore will, at its option, either repair or replace the Product (if it is so defective) without charge for parts, service
labor or associated customary return shipping cost to the Purchaser. Replacement for the Product may be by either new or
equivalent in performance to new. Replacement or repaired parts, or a replaced Product, will be warranted for only the unexpired
portion of the original warranty or 90 days (whichever is greater).

2.

Lake Shore warrants the Product only if the Product has been sold by an authorized Lake Shore employee, sales representative,
dealer or an authorized Lake Shore original equipment manufacturer (OEM).

3.

The Product may contain remanufactured parts equivalent to new in performance or may have been subject to incidental use
when it is originally sold to the Purchaser.

4.

The Warranty Period begins on the date the Product ships from Lake Shore’s plant.

5.

This limited warranty does not apply to defects in the Product resulting from (a) improper or inadequate installation (unless
OT&V services are performed by Lake Shore), maintenance, repair or calibration, (b) fuses, software, power surges, lightning
and non-rechargeable batteries, (c) software, interfacing, parts or other supplies not furnished by Lake Shore, (d) unauthorized
modification or misuse, (e) operation outside of the published specifications, (f) improper site preparation or site maintenance (g)
natural disasters such as flood, fire, wind, or earthquake, or (h) damage during shipment other than original shipment to you if
shipped through a Lake Shore carrier.

6.

This limited warranty does not cover: (a) regularly scheduled or ordinary and expected recalibrations of the Product; (b)
accessories to the Product (such as probe tips and cables, holders, wire, grease, varnish, feedthroughs, etc.); (c) consumables used
in conjunction with the Product (such as probe tips and cables, probe holders, sample tails, rods and holders, ceramic putty for
mounting samples, Hall sample cards, Hall sample enclosures, etc.); or, (d) non-Lake Shore branded Products that are integrated
with the Product.

7.

To the extent allowed by applicable law, this limited warranty is the only warranty applicable to the Product and replaces all
other warranties or conditions, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Specifically, except as provided herein.

8.

Lake Shore undertakes no responsibility that the products will be fit for any particular purpose for which you may be buying the
Products. Any implied warranty is limited in duration to the warranty period. No oral or written information, or advice given by
the Company, its Agents or Employees, shall create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of this limited warranty. Some
countries, states or provinces do not allow limitations on an implied warranty, so the above limitation or exclusion might not
apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you might also have other rights that vary from country to country,
state to state or province to province.

9.

Further, with regard to the United Nations Convention for International Sale of Goods (CISC,) if CISG is found to apply in
relation to this agreement, which is specifically disclaimed by Lake Shore, then this limited warranty excludes warranties that: (a)
the Product is fit for the purpose for which goods of the same description would ordinarily be used, (b) the Product is fit for any
particular purpose expressly or impliedly made known to Lake Shore at the time of the conclusion of the contract, (c) the Product
is contained or packaged in a manner usual for such goods or in a manner adequate to preserve and protect such goods where it is
shipped by someone other than a carrier hired by Lake Shore.

10. Lake Shore disclaims any warranties of technological value or of non-infringement with respect to the Product and Lake Shore
shall have no duty to defend, indemnify, or hold harmless you from and against any or all damages or costs incurred by you
arising from the infringement of patents or trademarks or violation or copyrights by the Product.
11. THIS WARRANTY IS NOT TRANSFERRABLE. This warranty is not transferrable.
12. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, neither Lake Shore nor any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or suppliers will be
held liable for direct, special, incidental, consequential or other damages (including lost profit, lost data, or downtime costs)
arising out of the use, inability to use or result of use of the product, whether based in warranty, contract, tort or other legal
theory, regardless whether or not Lake Shore has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Purchaser's use of the Product
is entirely at Purchaser's risk. Some countries, states and provinces do not allow the exclusion of liability for incidental or
consequential damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

13. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that vary within or between jurisdictions
where the product is purchased and/or used. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitation in certain warranties, and so the above
limitations or exclusions of some warranties stated above may not apply to you.
14. Except to the extent allowed by applicable law, the terms of this limited warranty statement do not exclude, restrict or modify the
mandatory statutory rights applicable to the sale of the product to you.

Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting MPS User’s Manual

Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) for the Model 625 Superconducting MPS
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of electronic equipment is a growing concern worldwide. Emissions of
and immunity to electromagnetic interference is now part of the design and manufacture of most electronics.
To qualify for the CE Mark, the Model 625 meets or exceeds the requirements of the European EMC Directive
89/336/EEC as a CLASS A product. A Class A product is allowed to radiate more RF than a Class B product
and must include the following warning:
WARNING:

This is a Class A product. In a domestic environment, this product may cause
radio interference in which case the user may be required to take adequate
measures.

The instrument was tested under normal operating conditions with sensor and interface cables attached. If the
installation and operating instructions in the User’s Manual are followed, there should be no degradation in
EMC performance.
This instrument is not intended for use in close proximity to RF Transmitters such as two-way radios and cell
phones. Exposure to RF interference greater than that found in a typical laboratory environment may disturb the
sensitive measurement circuitry of the instrument.
Pay special attention to instrument cabling. Improperly installed cabling may defeat even the best EMC
protection. For the best performance from any precision instrument, follow the grounding and shielding
instructions in the User’s Manual. In addition, the installer of the Model 625 should consider the following:
•

Shield measurement and computer interface cables.

•

Leave no unused or unterminated cables attached to the instrument.

•

Make cable runs as short and direct as possible. Higher radiated emissions is possible with long cables.

•

Do not tightly bundle cables that carry different types of signals.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.0 GENERAL
This chapter provides an introduction to the Model 625 Superconducting Magnet Power Supply. The Model 625 was
designed and manufactured in the United States of America by Lake Shore Cryotronics, Inc. The Model 625 features
include the following.
• True 4-quadrant (bipolar) 60 A, 5 V output
• 0.1 mA output setting resolution
• Linear regulation minimizes noise and ripple to 0.006% of maximum current into a 1 mΩ load.
• 1.0 mA stability per hour
• Two units can be connected in parallel for ±120 A operation
• CE compliance to both the low voltage directive and the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) directive (pending)
1.1 DESCRIPTION
The Model 625 Superconducting Magnet Power Supply is the ideal supply for small to medium sized superconducting
magnets used in high sensitivity materials research applications. The Model 625 is a practical alternative to both the
larger, one size fits all, superconducting magnet supplies and the endless adaptations of generic power supplies. By
limiting output power, Lake Shore was able to concentrate on the performance requirements of the most demanding
magnet users. The resulting Model 625 provides high precision, low noise, safety, and convenience.
Precision in magnetic measurements is typically defined as smooth continuous operation with high setting resolution and
low drift. Achieving these goals while driving a challenging load, such as a superconducting magnet, requires a unique
solution. The Model 625 delivers up to 60 A at a nominal compliance voltage of 5 V, with the supply acting as either a
source or a sink in true 4-quadrant operation. Its current source output architecture with analog control enables both
smooth operation and low drift. A careful blending of analog and digital circuits provides high setting resolution of
0.1 mA and flexible output programming.
Lake Shore chose linear input and output power stages for the moderate 300 W output of the Model 625. Linear
operation eliminates the radiated radio frequency (RF) noise associated with switching power supplies, allowing the
Model 625 to reduce the overall noise in its output and the noise radiated into surrounding electronics.
Safety should never be an afterthought when combining stored energy and liquid cryogens in a superconducting magnet
system. The Model 625 incorporates a variety of hardware and firmware protection features to ensure the safety of the
magnet and supply. For improved operator safety, the power supply was also designed for compliance with the safety
requirements of the CE mark, including both the low voltage and the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) directive.
Instrument users have come to rely on Lake Shore for convenience and ease of use. The Model 625 includes the features
necessary to conveniently manage a superconducting magnet. Features such as a persistent switch heater output,
calculated field reading, current ramping, and quench detection are all included. Computer interfaces are also integrated
for automation of the magnet system. The Model 625 is truly an excellent one-box solution for controlling a
superconducting magnet.
Output Architecture
True 4-quadrant output capability of the Model 625 is ideal for the charge and discharge cycling of superconducting
magnets for both positive and negative fields. Tightly integrated analog control of the 4-quadrant output provides smooth
current change with very low overshoot on output change. The Model 625 has the ability to charge and discharge
magnets up to a 5 V rate.
True 4-quadrant operation eliminates the need for external switching or operator intervention to reverse the current
polarity, significantly simplifying system design. The transition through zero current is smooth and continuous, allowing
the user to readily control the magnetic field as polarity changes.

At static fields, output current drift is also kept
low by careful attention in the analog control
circuits and layout. The high stability and low
noise of the Model 625 make it possible in many
situations to run experiments without going into
persistent mode. This can help to reduce the time
necessary to gather data.

The Model 625 output architecture relies on low
noise, linear input and output stages. The linear
circuitry of the Model 625 permits operation with
less electrical noise than switch-mode
superconducting magnet power supplies. One key
benefit of this architecture is CE compliance to
the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
directive, including the radiated emissions
requirement.
Output Programming
The Model 625 output current is programmed
* 5 A charge of an 8.6 H AMI magnet with a 95 mA/s ramp rate;
internally via the keypad or the computer
output current monitor measured at 58.88 Hz. rate with a HP
interface, externally by the analog programming

input, or by the sum of the external and internal
settings. For the more popular internal
programming, the Model 625 incorporates a proprietary digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that is monotonic over the
entire output range and provides a resolution of 0.1 mA.
The Model 625 generates extremely smooth and continuous ramps with virtually no overshoot. The digitally generated
constant current ramp rate is variable between 0.1 mA/s and 99.999 A/s. To ensure a smooth ramp rate, the power supply
updates the high-resolution DAC 28 times per second. A low-pass filter on the DAC output smooths the transitions at
step changes during ramping. Ramping can also be initiated by the trigger input.
The output compliance voltage of the Model 625 is settable to a value between 0.1 V and 5 V, with a 100 µV resolution.
The voltage is an absolute setting, so a 2 V setting will limit the output to greater than –2.0 V and less than +2.0 V.
Output Readings
The Model 625 provides high-resolution output readings. The output current reading reflects the actual current in the
magnet, and has a resolution of 0.1 mA. The output voltage reading reports the voltage at the output terminals with a
resolution of 100 µV. A remote voltage reading is also available to more accurately represent the magnet voltage by
bypassing voltage drops in the leads connecting the power supply to the magnet. All output readings can be prominently
displayed on the front panel and read over the computer interface.
Protection
Managing the stored energy in superconducting magnets necessitates several different types of protection. The Model
625 continuously monitors the load, line voltage, and internal circuits for signs of trouble. Any change outside of the
expected operating limits triggers the supply to bring the output to zero in a fail-safe mode. When line power is lost, the
output crowbar (SCR) will activate and maintain control of the magnet, discharging at a rate of 1 V until it reaches zero.
Quench detection is necessary to alert the user and to protect the magnet system. The Model 625 uses a basic and reliable
method for detecting a quench. If the current changes at a rate greater than the current step limit set by the operator, a
quench is detected and the output current is safely set to zero.
The remote inhibit input allows an external device to immediately set the output current to zero in case of a failure. This
input is normally tied to an external quench detection circuit, the fault output of a second power supply, or an emergency
shutdown button. The fault output is a relay contact that closes when a fault condition occurs. The contact closure alerts
other system components of the fault.

Parallel Operation
If an application requires more output current than a single Model 625 can provide, two supplies can be connected in
parallel for 120 A/5 V operation. Each unit is programmed for half of the total output current, operates independently,
and retains 0.1 mA resolution at 60 A operation. When the units are properly configured, either unit can detect a fault,
protect itself, and issue a fault output signaling the other unit to automatically enter the proper protection mode.
Persistent Switch Heater Output
The integrated persistent switch heater output is a controlled DC current source capable of driving most switch heaters. It
sources from 10 mA to 125 mA with a setting resolution of 1 mA and selectable compliance voltage of 12 V or 21 V.
The minimum load that the persistent switch heater can drive is 10 W. Persistent mode operation is integrated into the
instrument firmware to prevent mis-operation of the magnet.
Interfaces
The Model 625 includes IEEE-488 and RS-232C interfaces that provide access to operating data, stored parameters, and
remote control of all front panel operating functions. In addition, the Model 625 includes a trigger function that is used to
start an output current ramp. When the trigger is activated, either by an external trigger or by computer interface
command, the power supply will begin ramping to the new setpoint.
The Model 625 provides two analog outputs to monitor the output current and voltage. Each output is a buffered,
differential, analog voltage representation of the signal being monitored. The current monitor has a sensitivity of
1 V = 10 A, while the voltage monitor has a sensitivity of 1 V = 1 V.
Display and Keypad
The Model 625 incorporates a large 8-line by 40-character vacuum fluorescent display. Output current, calculated field
in tesla or gauss, output voltage, and remote voltage sense readings can be displayed simultaneously. Five LEDs on the
front panel provide quick verification of instrument status, including ramping, compliance, fault, PSH status, and
computer interface mode. Error conditions are indicated on the main display along with an audible beeper. Extended
error descriptions are available under the Status key.
The keypad is arranged logically to separate the different functions of the instrument. The most common functions of the
power supply are accessed using a single button press. The keypad can be locked to either lock out all changes or to lock
out just the instrument setup parameters allowing the output of the power supply to be changed.

1.3 SAFETY SUMMARY
Observe these safety precautions during all phases of instrument operation, service, and repair. Failure to comply with
these precautions or with specific warnings elsewhere in this manual violates safety standards of design, manufacture,
and intended instrument use. Lake Shore assumes no liability for Customer failure to comply with these requirements.
The Model 625 protects the operator and surrounding area from electric shock or burn, mechanical hazards, excessive
temperature, and spread of fire from the instrument. Environmental conditions outside of the conditions below may pose
a hazard to the operator and surrounding area.
• Indoor use.
• Altitude to 2000 meters.
• Temperature for safe operation: 5 °C to 40 °C.
• Overvoltage category II.
• Pollution degree 2.

• Maximum relative humidity: 80% for temperature up to
31 °C decreasing linearly to 50% at 40 °C.
• Power supply voltage fluctuations not to exceed ±10%
of the nominal voltage.

Ground the Instrument

To minimize shock hazard, the instrument is equipped with a 3-conductor AC power cable. Plug the power cable into
an approved three-contact electrical outlet or use a three-contact adapter with the grounding wire (green) firmly
connected to an electrical ground (safety ground) at the power outlet. The power jack and mating plug of the power
cable meet Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) safety standards.
Ventilation

The instrument has ventilation holes in its side covers. Do not block these holes when the instrument is operating.
Do Not Operate in An Explosive Atmosphere

Do not operate the instrument in the presence of flammable gases or fumes. Operation of any electrical instrument in
such an environment constitutes a definite safety hazard.
Keep Away from Live Circuits

Operating personnel must not remove instrument covers. Refer component replacement and internal adjustments to
qualified maintenance personnel. Do not replace components with power cable connected. To avoid injuries, always
disconnect power and discharge circuits before touching them.
Do Not Substitute Parts or Modify Instrument

Do not install substitute parts or perform any unauthorized modification to the instrument. Return the instrument to an
authorized Lake Shore representative for service and repair to ensure that safety features are maintained.
Cleaning

Do not submerge instrument. Clean only with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Exterior only.
Moving and Handling

Four handles are provided for ease of moving and handling the Model 625. Always use at least two, and if possible
four, handles when carrying the unit.

CHAPTER 2
MAGNET SYSTEM DESIGN
2.0 GENERAL
This chapter provides information on general magnet system design. It is intended to give the user insight into
superconducting materials, superconducting magnets, persistent switches, Dewars, and cabling issues. For information
on how to install the Model 625 please refer to Chapter 3. Instrument operation information is contained in Chapter 4.
2.1 SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS
Superconducting materials have a very special property, that when cooled to very low temperatures, they become perfect
conductors of electricity. The transition to the superconducting state happens abruptly as the critical temperature is
reached. When the material is in its superconducting state, it has absolutely zero resistance. Such materials have a variety
of applications, one of which is for the construction of high field magnets.
The unique properties of superconductors make them ideal for use in high field magnets. Since a superconductor has no
resistance it requires no voltage to maintain a current through it. Magnet grade superconductors also have a very high
current density allowing a relatively small wire to carry a large amount of current that can be used to generate large
magnetic fields.
There are three properties that determine if a material is in its superconducting state. The first property is critical
temperature. A superconductor needs to be cooled in order to transition to a superconducting state. This temperature is
called its critical temperature. Most materials need to be cooled with liquid helium in order to reach their critical
temperatures although some ceramics have shown to have a critical temperature as high as 125 K which would be
suitable for nitrogen cooling.
The second property is critical current density. A superconducting wire can only carry a certain amount of current in its
superconducting state. The current density of a typical superconducting wire made from niobium-titanium is on the order
of 1010 A/m2, about three orders of magnitude greater than normal house wiring. If the critical current density is
exceeded, the wire will return to its normal resistive state.
The last property is critical field. A superconductor will return to its normal resistive state if it is exposed to a magnetic
field larger than its critical field. Superconducting wire such as niobium-titanium and niobium-tin have critical fields in
excess of 10 T and 20 T respectively. Elemental superconductors, such as lead, have very low critical fields, in this case
0.08 T, and are not suited for creating superconducting magnets.
All three of these properties are related to one another. For instance, a superconducting wire is able to carry more current
and withstand a higher magnetic field as it is cooled to a lower temperature. In the case of niobium-titanium, a common
superconducting wire, the critical temperature is 9.3 K but at that temperature both the critical field and critical current
density are both zero. At a temperature of 6 K, the critical field increases to approximately 7 T and at 4 K it is
approximately 11 T.
2.2 SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS
Superconducting magnets are wound from many turns of superconducting wire. They are used to generate magnetic
fields that are larger than can be achieved with permanent magnets or electromagnets or when field stability is important.
They can also be more economical to run than electromagnets since the power needed to maintain the charge is minimal.
2.2.1

Superconducting Magnet Construction

The magnetic field (B) that can be generated by a solenoid is given by the equation B=μ0In/l, where μ0 is the
permeability of air, I is the current in the wire, n is the number of turns, and l is the length of the solenoid. Most
superconducting magnets are wound using a conductor made from many fine strands of niobium-titanium (NbTi) or
niobium-tin (Nb3Sn) embedded in a copper matrix. The copper matrix is used for mechanical stability and to provide a
path for large currents in the case of a magnet quench. Typically, niobium-tin is only used in magnets that can generate
fields in excess of 9 Tesla because it is more expensive and harder to work with than niobium-titanium.

Magnet System Design

2-1

Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting MPS User’s Manual

The superconducting wire is wound around a non-magnetic former made from aluminum, brass, stainless steel, or other
material as needed. The individual windings are electrically insulated by the insulation on the wire and by an epoxy that
is applied to the windings. The epoxy is also necessary to keep the individual windings from moving when the magnet is
charged.

Figure 2-1. Typical Superconducting Magnet

2.2.2

Magnet Inductance

The inductance of a solenoid (L) is defined as L = μ0n2A/l, where μ0 is the permeability of air, n is the number of turns, A
is the cross-sectional area of the coil, and l is the length of the solenoid. The inductance of superconducting magnets is
fairly large, typically between 10 and 100 Henries. The magnet’s inductance limits the rate at which the magnet can be
charged or discharged because of the increased voltage required to change current. The formula V = L (di/dt) relates
charging voltage to inductance where V is the charging voltage, L is the magnet inductance, and di/dt is the rate of
change in current. The Model 625 can charge a magnet up to a 5 V rate, although many magnets are not designed to be
charged at that rate. For instance, a 10 Henry magnet can be charged at a rate of 0.5 A/s with a 5 V limit. A rate of 0.1
A/s is more typical.

2-2

Magnet System Design

Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting MPS User’s Manual

The resistance of the leads must be taken into account when calculating charge rate since a voltage drop across the leads
will limit the voltage that can be delivered to the terminals of the magnet. This becomes especially important as the
charging current rises since the voltage drop across the leads will increase.
2.2.3

Maximum Ramp Rate

Not only is the rate at which a magnet can be charged limited to the magnet’s inductance but it is also limited by the
magnet’s construction. When a magnet is charged or discharged, heat is generated in the coils. The faster the ramp rate,
the more heat that will be generated. If the heat cannot be conducted out of the magnet fast enough, a section of the
superconducting windings can go normal and cause a quench. The magnet manufacturer should state the maximum ramp
rate of the magnet. In some magnets, the current cannot be changed at the same rate over the entire current range of the
magnet. These magnets need to be charged at a slower rate as they reach their maximum current rating.
2.2.4

Maximum Magnet Current

Although superconducting wire can carry more current than non-superconducting wire of the same size, the amount of
current that it can carry is not unlimited. If the critical current of the wire is exceeded, the wire will no longer be
superconducting and will revert to its normal state causing the magnet to quench. Commercially purchased magnets have
been designed to work up to a maximum stated current. The magnet should be able to handle a quench up to the rated
current of the magnet. Do not exceed the maximum current rating of the magnet or the magnet can quench and possibly
be damaged.
2.2.5

Magnet Quench Protection Diodes

Many superconducting magnets have protection diodes installed across the terminals of the magnet. These diodes will
turn on in the event of a quench and will help dissipate some of the magnets energy. Typically, the diodes are attached to
the magnet itself and are submerged in the cryogen. At 4.2 K the forward voltage of the diodes may be on the order of 10
volts. If the magnet quenches, the energy dissipated in the diodes will warm them, resulting in a decrease in their forward
voltage. If this voltage drops below the compliance voltage limit of the power supply, the power supply will continue to
source current to the diodes eventually damaging them and causing them to short. This would require that the protection
diodes be replaced which could be a significant expense especially if the magnet is in a sealed Dewar.
To ensure that the diodes are not damaged by the power supply, the compliance voltage limit of the supply should be set
to a voltage below the protection diode range. It is also recommended that some form of quench detection be used to
force the output of the power supply to 0 amps when a quench is detected ensuring that no additional current is being
supplied to the diodes. The Model 625 offers both internal quench detection and a remote inhibit line that can be
connected to an external quench detection circuit.
2.3 PERSISTENT SWITCHES
Some superconducting magnets are constructed with a persistent switch. A persistent switch is a length of
superconducting wire that shorts across the terminals of the magnet. This length of wire can be heated and drives it into a
resistive state so that a voltage can be applied across the magnet terminals and the magnet can be charged or discharged.
When the heater is shut off, this section of wire will cool and become superconducting again and the magnet will be in
persistent mode. At this time, the power supply can be ramped to zero current and even removed from the system while
the magnet holds its charge.
One of the reasons to use a persistent switch is when a very stable field is required. When the magnet is in persistent
mode, all of the current is being circulated within the magnet with no interference from outside sources. Another reason
to use a persistent switch is when it is desired to hold a particular magnet field for an extended period of time, such as in
a MRI system. Once the magnet is in persistent mode, the power supply can be removed from the system and used
elsewhere. It is also possible on some systems to remove the vapor cooled leads from the Dewar to further reduce the
amount of helium boil off.
The magnet manufacturer will specify the current necessary to turn on the persistent switch heater. Do not use any more
current than is necessary since that will result in excess helium boil off. It is important when turning on the persistent
switch heater that the current setting of the power supply is equal to the current in the magnet. If the current does not
match, the current in the magnet will ramp to the current setting of the power supply at the compliance voltage limit.
This may cause the power supply to incorrectly detect a quench.

2.4 MAGNET CURRENT LEADS
The power supply should be placed close to the magnet to reduce the length of the lead wires. The resistance of the wires
becomes very important when such large currents are being supplied to the magnet. The rate at which a magnet can be
charged depends on the voltage that can be supplied across the terminals of the magnet given by the equation V = L
(di/dt). The voltage is limited by the maximum voltage the power supply can output minus the voltage that is lost
through the magnet leads. Use lead wires heavy enough to limit the voltage drop to less than 0.5 volts per lead and keep
conductor temperature under 85 °C for a 35 °C ambient temperature. Table 2-1 lists the current capacity and total lead
lengths for load connections.

The Remote Voltage Sense connection can be used to monitor the voltage directly across the terminals of the magnet.
This will give a more accurate voltage reading across the terminals of the magnet by eliminating the voltage drop in the
leads. Some magnets manufacturers provide voltage sense connections directly at the terminals of the magnet. If these
are not available, they can be added and the signals can be brought out of the Dewar to be connected to the power
supply. If it is not desirable to add wiring inside the Dewar, the sense leads can be connected to the magnet current leads
at the Dewar. The remote voltage sense input can only be used to read the voltage at the magnet terminals and cannot be
used to control the voltage limit.
2.5 HELIUM DEWARS 1
Since superconducting magnets need to be run at cryogenic temperatures, they are installed in Dewars filled with liquid
helium. A Dewar usually consists of one or more reservoirs surrounded by a vacuum jacket. This vacuum jacket
insulates the reservoir from room temperatures. In Dewars with multiple reservoirs, the outside reservoir is normally
filled with liquid nitrogen as a way to further reduce the heat transfer from the liquid helium filled inner reservoir. Most
Dewars are made from stainless steel although they can also be made from glass or epoxy-fiberglass and aluminum.
Stainless steel is used because it is very rugged, has low thermal conductivity, and can easily be welded to different types
of metals.
The most basic Dewars are of an all welded construction with an opening in the top for direct access to the cryogen
reservoir. The Dewar will have an evacuation valve to evacuate the vacuum jacket surrounding the cryogen reservoir.
There will also be a pressure relief valve to protect the vacuum jacket in case a leak should develop. This leak would
allow cold cryogen into the vacuum jacket where it will expand upon contact with the room temperature wall. This
pressure relief valve is set to open between 2 and 5 psi to safely vent the leaking gas.
The superconducting magnet can either be supported by the insert or supported by a base in the bottom of the Dewar. If
the magnet is in the base of the Dewar, it is usually installed when the Dewar is built and can only be removed or
serviced by cutting the Dewar apart. Any insert that is placed in the helium reservoir should contain a number of
radiation baffles in the neck region of the Dewar. These baffles are normally made from copper and are cooled by the
escaping helium gas. This will help cut down on radiation losses from the room temperature top flange on the insert. It
will also help to cut down on conductive heat loss being transferred down the neck of the dewar. The high current leads
used for charging the magnet should be vapor cooled to reduce the amount of heat that is transferred into the helium
reservoir.

With the magnet submerged in liquid helium, it will be at a temperature of 4.2 K at atmospheric pressure. Some magnets
are rated to work at 2.2 K allowing a larger field to be generated. This temperature can be achieved by lowering the
pressure over the helium reservoir thereby lowering the boiling point of the helium. Some Dewars will have a pumping
port that can be attached to a vacuum pump to reduce the pressure and lower the temperature but will increase the rate of
liquid helium consumption.
The amount of energy that can be stored in a magnet is given by the equation E = ½LI2. Typical laboratory magnets have
inductances of 10 to 100 Henries and can have maximum currents of 40 to 120 Amps. The energy stored in a typical
magnet can be anywhere from a few thousand Joules to over one hundred thousand Joules. In the case of a magnet
quench, all of this energy is going to be dumped into the liquid helium within a matter of a few seconds creating a large
amount of helium gas. Any Dewar that is used with a superconducting magnet should have a pressure relief port on the
helium reservoir to allow the helium gas to be dissipated in the case of a quench.
The level of the liquid helium can be monitored by using a liquid helium level sensor installed in the Dewar. The level of
the helium should never be allowed to drop below the top of the magnet while the magnet is in operation. Allowing the
magnet to become uncovered can cause a quench. Also, the level of the helium should never be higher than the inlets of
the vapor cooled current leads. If the inlets are submerged in liquid helium, the helium gas can no longer cool the leads
and extra heat will be transferred into the helium reservoir increasing the rate of helium boil off.
2.6 MAGNET QUENCH
A magnet quench occurs when part of the superconducting wire in the magnet becomes normal and has resistance. When
a section of the magnet becomes resistive it will begin to heat and will cause more of the magnet to become resistive.
This causes an unstoppable chain reaction that will result in the magnet dissipating all of its energy into heat. This can
happen if the critical temperature, critical current, or critical field are exceeded. Refer to Paragraph 2.1 for a description
of superconductor properties. Even though a quench is not necessarily destructive to the magnet, it should be avoided at
all costs. Always check the level of liquid helium and make sure that the magnet is completely covered before operating
the magnet. Never ramp a magnet at a ramp rate greater than what is specified by the magnet manufacturer. Never
exceed the current rating of the magnet since a quench in this case can easily damage the magnet.
Typically, the current in the magnet will be completely dissipated in about a half of a second causing the magnet to heat.
It may then take several minutes before the liquid helium cools the magnet back to its superconducting state. Since a
quench can boil off a significant amount of helium, always check the helium level before operating the magnet after a
quench.

Verify that the AC line voltage indicator in the fuse drawer window shows the appropriate AC line voltage before
turning the instrument on. The instrument may be damaged if it is turned on with the wrong voltage selected. Instructions
for changing the line voltage configuration are given in Paragraph 7.4.
3.3.2

Line Fuse and Fuse Holder

The line fuse is an important safety feature of the Model 625. If a fuse ever fails, it is important to replace it with the
value and type indicated on the rear panel for the line voltage setting. The letter T on the fuse rating indicates that the
instrument requires a time-delay or slow-blow fuse. Fuse values should be verified any time line voltage configuration is
changed. Instructions for changing and verifying a line fuse are given in Paragraph 7.5.
3.3.3

Power Cord

The Model 625 includes a 3-conductor power cord that mates with the IEC 320-C14 line cord receptacle. Line voltage is
present on the two outside conductors and the center conductor is a safety ground. The safety ground attaches to the
instrument chassis and protects the user in case of a component failure. A CE approved power cord is included with
instruments shipped to Europe; a domestic power cord is included with all other instruments (unless otherwise specified
when ordered). Always plug the power cord into a properly grounded receptacle to ensure safe operation of the
instrument.
The delicate nature of measurement being taken near this instrument may necessitate additional grounding including
ground strapping of the instrument chassis. In these cases, the operators safety should remain the highest priority and low
impedance from the instrument chassis to safety ground should always be maintained.

Power Switch

The power switch is on the front panel of the Model 625 and turns line power to the instrument On and Off. When the
circle is depressed, power is Off. When the line is depressed, power is On.
3.4 MAGNET CABLE CONNECTIONS
Magnet cable connections are made at the +OUTPUT and –OUTPUT terminals on the rear panel. These plated copper
bus bars accommodate ¼ inch (M6) mounting hardware. Use load wires heavy enough to limit the voltage drop to less
than 0.5 volts per lead. This ensures proper regulation and prevents overheating while carrying the output current. The
remote voltage sense leads can be used to measure the actual magnet voltage. Keep conductor temperature under 85 °C
(185 °F) for a 35 °C (95 °F) ambient. Table 3-1 lists the current capacity and total lead lengths for load connections.

External Current Programming

The output current can be programmed externally using an analog voltage. This programming voltage can also be
summed with the internal current setting. Refer to Paragraph 4.18 to change the external program mode. The external
current programming input is a differential input with a sensitivity of 1 V = 10 A and an input impedance of > 50 kΩ.
The programming voltage is limited internally to approximately ±6.1 V but care must be taken to ensure that maximum
current capability of the magnet is never exceeded.

3.5.2

Remote Voltage Sense

The Model 625 provides a connection for remote voltage sense leads. This connection is normally used to measure the
voltage at the magnet allowing a more accurate reading of magnet voltage by eliminating voltage drops in the leads
connecting the power supply to the magnet. This voltage reading can be displayed on the front panel or read over the
computer interface. Refer to Paragraph 4.4.2 to configure the display to show the remote voltage sense reading. The
remote voltage sense connection is a differential input capable of reading ±5 V and an input impedance of > 50 kΩ.
3.5.3

Output Current and Voltage Monitors

The output current and output voltage of the power supply can be monitored externally using the monitor output
connections on the Analog I/O connector. Each output is a buffered, differential, analog voltage representation of the
signal being monitored. The current monitor has a sensitivity of 1 V = 10 A and the voltage monitor has a sensitivity of
1 V = 1V. Both outputs have a source impedance of 20 Ω.
3.6 DIGITAL INPUT/OUTPUT CONNECTIONS
The Digital I/O connector provides connections to digital control signals. Two of these connections, Remote Inhibit and
Trigger In, are inputs used to control the state of the power supply. The Fault Out is an output that is used to signal error
conditions.

Fault Output

The fault output is a relay contact closure that closes to indicate a fault condition. The relay contact is rated at 30 VDC at
1 A. The contact closure alerts other system components of the fault. If the power supply detects an internal hardware
fault, the fault relay is closed, the front panel fault LED is lit, and the condition is latched. If the power supply detects an
operational fault, the fault relay will close for 1 second and then open and the front panel LED will blink. When two
Model 625s are connected in parallel, the fault output should be wired to the remote inhibit line of the other supply.
Refer to Paragraph 3.9 for details on connecting two power supplies in parallel.

Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting MPS User’s Manual

3.6.2

Remote Inhibit

The Remote Inhibit connection on the Digital I/O connector is an input that instructs the power supply to immediately set
the output current to 0 A. This input allows an external device to immediately shut off the output current of the supply in
case of a failure. This input is normally tied to an external quench detection circuit, the fault output of a second power
supply, or an emergency shut down button. This function will only set the output current to zero, so if the magnet is still
charged, it will discharge at a rate determined by the compliance voltage limit. The Remote Inhibit input is TTL
compatible and a logic low will activate it. The signal is internally pulled up to allow operation with a simple switch
closure. Refer to Figure 3-5.

Figure 3-5. Remote Inhibit and Trigger In Operation
3.6.3

Trigger In

The Trigger In connection on the Digital I/O connector is an input that is used to start an output current ramp. The trigger
can only be armed from the computer interface using the TRIG command to setup a new output current setpoint. When
the Trigger In line is activated, the power supply will begin ramping to the new setpoint. Once the instrument has been
triggered, the TRIG command needs to be sent again along with a new setpoint to rearm the trigger. The Trigger In input
is TTL compatible and a logic low will activate it. The signal is internally pulled up to allow operation with a simple
switch closure. Refer to Figure 3-5.
3.7 PERSISTENT SWITCH HEATER OUTPUT
The persistent switch heater output is a controlled DC current source capable of sourcing up to 125 mA with a jumper
selectable compliance voltage limit of 15 V or 24 V. The default setting is 24V. Refer to Paragraph 7.11 to configure the
compliance voltage limit of the persistent switch heater output. The actual voltage compliance limit is dependant on load
but guaranteed to be at least 12 V or 21 V depending on the setting. The heater output current is software settable in
1 mA steps from 10 to 125 mA. Typically, the magnet manufacturer specifies the persistent switch heater current. The
minimum load that the persistent switch heater can drive is 10 Ω. If the persistent switch heater is less than 10 Ω a series
resistance needs to be added or else the PSH circuit will falsely detect a short circuit. Refer to Paragraph 4.14 to setup the
persistent switch heater.

Heater Output Connection

BNC receptacle provides connections for the persistent switch heater output. Signal is carried on the center conductor
and heater common is on the outer conductor. The heater output has a maximum voltage of 24 V and can source
125 mA. Mating connector not included.
3.7.2

Heater Output Cabling

Coaxial cable is recommended for the heater output, outside of the test Dewar. The center conductor should be large
enough to carry the maximum 125 mA current to prevent accidental burn out of the conductor.

3.8 INSTRUMENT GROUNDING AND ISOLATION
Chassis grounded circuits should have a low impedance path to Earth ground for both performance and safety. This is
achieved by using a 3-conductor power cord in a properly grounded outlet. All instrumentation that is connected to the
analog outputs or computer interface (or use Earth ground as measurement common) should have similar low impedance
to the same ground. Good grounding of all chassis in a group of instruments prevents voltage differences between their
chassis (usually at line frequency) from inducing noise on the measurement. If good quality Earth ground is not
available, the chassis of line powered instruments should be strapped together with heavy gauge copper wire or ground
strap. Signal leads in communication cables should not be relied on for ground strapping.
The high current output stage in the Model 625 uses a bridging output technology and is optically isolated from power
line ground. Optical isolation of the output stage provides noise immunity from power line (Earth) related ground loops
with outside measurement equipment.
A 100-ohm internal resistor ties the power line ground to the internal output stage common to provide a reference to the
output stage in instances where the output is allowed to float. This is to prevent electrostatic build up between the
isolated sections of the Model 625. If the magnet coil is left ungrounded, this is the only path that keeps the commonmode voltage of the magnet at or near earth ground. In many instances, it is expected that one of current output terminals
will be attached to power line ground. In this instance, it is recommended that the negative terminal be attached to power
line ground since tying the positive terminal to ground will result in a small current reading error of 30 – 70 mA. Either
output terminal can be connected to power line ground without damage.
The computer interfaces are still referenced to power line ground. The Output Voltage Monitor and Output Current
Monitor outputs are sourced from the isolated output stage but are electronically balanced and have a common-mode
voltage limit of 10 V. This limit is more than adequate for any equipment that is referenced to power line ground.
Similarly, the External Current Programming and Remote Voltage inputs are differential and allow easy interface to
power line grounded equipment.
3.9 CONNECTING MULTIPLE UNITS IN PARALLEL
Up to two Model 625’s can be connected in parallel to provide up to 120 A of current at a maximum compliance voltage
of 5 V. When the units are connected, they are still operated individually. The total amount of current supplied to the
load is the sum of the currents that each supply is delivering. If both supplies are ramping current at the same time, then
the total ramp rate is equal to the sum of both the ramp rates as long as neither of the supplies reaches its compliance
voltage limit. If the compliance voltage limits of the two supplies are not the same, then the total compliance voltage is
limited to the lower setting of the two supplies.
To connect two power supplies together, the +OUTPUT and –OUTPUT terminals of one supply should be connected to
the +OUTPUT and –OUTPUT terminals of the other supply respectively. Make these leads as short as possible to
minimize output potential differences between the two power supplies and use a heavy enough gauge wire to carry at
least 60 A. Refer to Table 3-1 for wire gauge properties. Connect the +OUTPUT and –OUTPUT terminals of one of the
supplies to the load using a heavy enough gauge wire to carry 120 A. On the Digital I/O connector, connect the Fault
Output of each supply to the Remote Inhibit of the other supply. Be sure to secure the Digital I/O connectors to the
power supplies with the connector screws. When all connections are made, power up both supplies at the same time. It is
possible that one or both of the supplies will power up with a Remote Inhibit fault detected if both supplies are not
powered up at the same time. If this occurs, wait until both units have powered up and then clear the error using the
Status key. Refer to Paragraph 7.6 for information on clearing errors. Lake Shore sells a Dual Supply Interconnect Cable
Kit with all of the necessary cables to connect two supplies in parallel. Refer to Paragraph 6.2 for ordering accessories.

3.10 RACK MOUNTING
The Model 625 can be installed into a 19-inch rack mount cabinet using the included rack mount hardware and 19-inch
rack support rails. The power supply comes from the factory with feet installed. These feet need to be removed if the
supply is going to be rack mounted. Be sure to reinstall the screws once the feet are removed. Due to the weight of the
power supply, it is recommended that the supply be mounted at the bottom of the rack. For ventilation, the back of the
rack should be open and a 1U (44 mm high) ventilation cover should be mounted on the rack above and below the power
supply. Use 19-inch rack support rails (not included) fastened to the front and back of the cabinet to support the weight
of the supply.
CAUTION: The front panel rack mount brackets are used to hold the power supply securely to the front of the rack.
The rack support rails, not the front panel brackets, must support the weight of the supply.

CHAPTER 4
OPERATION
4.0 GENERAL
This chapter provides operating instructions for the features of the Model 625 Superconducting Magnet Power Supply.
Computer interface instructions are in Chapter 5.
4.1 TURNING POWER ON
Verify that the AC line voltage indicator in the fuse drawer window shows the appropriate AC line voltage before
turning the instrument on. The instrument may be damaged if it is turned on with the wrong voltage selected. Instructions
for checking line voltage selection are given in Paragraph 3.3.1.
NOTE: It is recommended that the instrument be powered up and operated with the shorting bar in place before
connecting it to a magnet. This will allow the user to setup the supply and become comfortable with its
operation without risk of damage to the magnet.
When the Model 625 is turned on, the display shows the Lake Shore logo and the alarm beeper sounds briefly. After a
few seconds, a “Checking Hardware” message will appear while the instrument does an internal diagnostic and makes
sure everything is working before the output is turned on. Most of the instrument setup parameter values are retained
when power is off with a few exceptions. The output current will always be set to 0 A anytime the instrument is powered
up. The persistent switch heater, if enabled, will be turned off. When the instrument is powered on for the first time
parameter values are set to their defaults, as listed in Table 4-1.
When initialization is complete the instrument will begin its normal reading cycle and current or field readings should
appear on the display. Any error messages will appear in the bottom of the display. Messages listed in Table 7-1,
Instrument Hardware Errors, are related to the instrument hardware and may require help from Lake Shore service. The
messages listed in Table 7-2, Operational Errors, are related to instrument operation and may be corrected with user
intervention.
The Model 625 should be allowed to warm up for a minimum of 30 minutes to achieve rated accuracy.
4.2 DISPLAY DEFINITION
The Model 625 has an 8 line by 40 character vacuum fluorescent (VF) display capable of showing both text and graphic
images. This paragraph describes features of the display that appear during normal operation including current
measurement, voltage measurement, and current programming. Other display configurations appear during parameter
setting and data entry operations. These displays are illustrated in their individual operation paragraphs.
4.2.1

General Keypad Operation

The Model 625 uses three basic keypad operations, direct operation, setting selection and data entry, for the majority of
operator interface. A few specialized keypad operations, such as ramp segment entry, are described in the individual
operation paragraphs.
Direct Operation: Key functions occur immediately when the key is pressed. Zero Output, Stop Output, and Pause
Output are examples of keys that operate this way.
Setting Selection: Allows the user to select from a finite list of parameter values. During setting selection the s and t
keys are used to select a parameter value. Enter is used to accept the change and advance to the next parameter. Escape
will cancel the change to that parameter and return to the normal display. Setting selection screens always include the
message: “Select with s t ”.
Data Entry: Allows the user to enter numeric parameter values using the data entry keys that are printed on the key tops.
Data entry keys include numbers from 0 to 9, sign, and decimal point. The labels printed above the keys describe the key
function during normal operation. When one of the keys is pressed and a data entry sequence is started, the keys follow
the data entry functions printed on the key tops. Once the correct parameter value is entered, press Enter to accept the
change and advance to next parameter. Pressing Escape once will clear the new value and restart the setting sequence.
Pressing Escape again will return to the normal display. Data entry screens always include the message: “Enter a value
for”.
Related setting selection and data entry sequences are often chained together under a single key. To skip over a
parameter without changing its value, press Enter before pressing an arrow or number key. To return to the normal
display in the middle of a setting sequence, press Escape before pressing an arrow or number key. Changes “entered”
before Escape is pressed are kept.

4.4 DISPLAY SETUP
The display of the Model 625 is designed so that all of the pertinent operational information is being presented in a
logical manner. The most important readings, either output current and voltage or calculated magnetic field, are
displayed using large 11 × 15 block characters that can be seen from across the room. The remote voltage sense readings
can be displayed if they are being utilized or they can be removed from the display altogether.
4.4.1

Display Mode

The Model 625 is able to display in two modes, output current mode or magnetic field mode. In output current mode, the
output current and voltage are displayed using large 11 × 15 block characters. In magnet field mode, the calculated
magnet field is displayed using large 11 × 15 block characters. The display mode also changes the way the Output
Setting key works. In current mode, the output setting value will be in units of amps (A) but in field mode, the output
setting value will be in units of field, either kG or T. Refer to Paragraph 4.5 to set the output current.
To configure the display press Display Setup. The first display setup screen appears as a prompt for the display mode.

4.4.2

Display Remote Voltage Sense

The Model 625 has the ability to display a remote voltage sense reading. This connection is available on the rear panel of
the instrument. See Paragraph 3.5.2 for information on how to connect the remote voltage sense leads. These leads are
normally used to monitor the voltage at the terminals of the magnet. The remote voltage sense reading can be displayed
or hidden if the remote voltage sense leads are not being used. Note that the remote voltage sense leads will always be
read, only the display function can be turned on or off. The sense voltage cannot be used as the compliance voltage.
To change the remote voltage sense display, continue from the display mode screen or press Display Setup then Enter
until the following display setup screen appears as a prompt for the remote voltage sense display.

Display Brightness

The vacuum fluorescent (VF) display on the Model 625 has four brightness settings between 100% and 25% that can be
changed from the front panel. The brightness setting changes the entire VF display but does not affect the LED
annunciators to the right of the display. Continuous use of the instrument at 100% brightness will reduce the operating
life of the display and brightness of 25% is recommended for most applications.
To change display brightness, continue from the remote voltage sense display screen or press Display Setup then Enter
until the following display setup screen appears as a prompt for display brightness.

to the normal display. Press Escape to cancel the new selection and return to the normal display.
4.5 SETTING OUTPUT CURRENT
The main purpose of the Model 625 Superconducting Power Supply is to supply a very precise and stable current to a
highly inductive load. Before setting output current, make sure that the instrument is properly setup for the magnet
system that is being used. This includes setting up the maximum output current, maximum compliance voltage limit,
maximum ramp rate, quench detection, and PSH parameters. When a new output current setting is entered, the supply
will ramp from the current setting to the new setting at the current ramp rate, unless limited by the compliance voltage.
The Ramping LED will be lit while the output current setting is ramping. When the output current setting is entered, it
will be limited in magnitude by the maximum current setting. Refer to Paragraph 4.11 to setup the maximum settings.
To change the output current setting when in current display mode, press the Output Setting key. The output current
setting value on the normal display will be highlighted to prompt for the new output current setting value.

Set : + 0. 0000 A
Use the data entry keys to enter an output current setting value between –60.0000 and + 60.0000. Press Enter to accept
the new value. Press Escape to restart the setting sequence and enter a different value. Press Escape again to leave the
setting sequence.
NOTE: The output current setting value can be set as high as ±60.1000 A. This can be used to compensate for current
loss due to high resistance leads and for variances in calibration. The output current is guaranteed to reach a
minimum of 60 A but may not be able to reach 60.1 A in all circumstances.
If the display mode is set to field display mode, then the output setting value is also in units of field, either kG or T.
Refer to Paragraph 4.13 to setup the field constant and units. Even when the output is in units of field, the other
parameters remain the same. The ramp rate is still in units of A/s and the maximum current setting is still used.
There are certain circumstances in which the current will not be allowed to change. This is done for safety and to protect
the magnet system. If the output current is going to be kept from changing, an error box will pop up explaining why the
new setting is going to be ignored. These error boxes are described below.

The output current setting is not allowed to change while the persistent switch heater is warming or cooling. The amount
of time it takes for the PSH to warm or cool is system dependent and can be setup under the PSH Setup key. Refer to
Paragraph 4.14 to setup the persistent switch heater.
Ch a n g e n o t a l l o we d wh i l e
i n Ex t e r n a l Cu r r e n t Pr o g r a m Mo d e .
The output current setting is not allowed to change if the instrument is setup so that the output current is programmed
solely by an external voltage. Refer to Paragraph 4.18 to setup the external program mode.
Ch a n g e n o t a l l o we d wh i l e
r a mp r a t e > c u r r e n t s t e p l i mi t .
The output current setting is not allowed to change if the current ramp rate is greater than the current step limit and
quench detection is on. The current step limit is a parameter of quench detection. If the current were allowed to change at
a rate greater than the current step limit, then a quench would be falsely detected. Refer to Paragraph 4.16 to setup
quench detection.
Ch a n g e n o t a l l o we d wh i l e
ma x r a mp r a t e > c u r r e n t s t e p l i mi t .
As stated above, the current ramp rate cannot exceed the current step limit used for quench detection. To ensure that the
ramp rate will never accidentally exceed the current step limit either by entering a ramp rate from the front panel or by
having the ramp segments function set a new ramp rate, the maximum ramp rate must be less than the current step limit.
Refer to Paragraph 4.11 to setup maximum settings.
4.6 CURRENT RAMP RATE
The output current of the Model 625 will always ramp from one current setting to another. There is no way to turn off the
current ramping function, but if a very fast ramp rate is desired, a ramp rate as large as 99.999 A/s can be entered to
simulate a step change. On most superconducting magnets, the maximum rate at which it can be charged is usually
stated. Exceeding the maximum charging rate can cause the magnet to quench. When the current ramp rate is entered or
changed by crossing into a different ramp segment, it will be limited in magnitude by the maximum ramp rate. Refer to
Paragraph 4.12 to setup the ramp segments and to Paragraph 4.11 to setup the maximum settings.
To change the current ramp rate press the Ramp Rate key. The ramp rate value on the normal display will be
highlighted to prompt for the new ramp rate value.

Ra t e : 1 . 0 0 0 0 A/ s
Use the data entry keys to enter the ramp rate value between 0.0001 and 99.999 A/s. Press Enter to accept the new
value. Press Escape to restart the setting sequence and enter a different value. Press Escape again to leave the setting
sequence.
If the persistent mode ramp rate is enabled and the magnet is in persistent mode, then the current ramp rate will not be
allowed to change using the Ramp Rate key. To change the current ramp rate, either disable the persistent mode ramp
rate feature or enter a new persistent mode ramp rate using the PSH Setup key. Refer to Paragraph 4.14.4 to setup the
persistent mode ramp rate. The error box shown below will pop up explaining why the new setting is going to be
ignored.

4.7 COMPLIANCE VOLTAGE LIMIT
The output compliance voltage limit of the Model 625 can be set between 0.1 and 5 V. The setting is in magnitude only
and will limit both positive and negative voltages.
On most superconducting magnets, the maximum compliance voltage is usually stated and can vary depending on the
current in the magnet. Exceeding the maximum compliance voltage of the magnet can cause the magnet to quench. The
compliance voltage can be limited by setting the maximum compliance voltage setting. Refer to Paragraph 4.11 to setup
the maximum settings.
To change the compliance voltage limit press the Voltage Limit key. The compliance voltage limit value on the normal
display will be highlighted to prompt for the new compliance voltage limit value.

V Li mi t : 5 . 0 0 0 0 V
Use the data entry keys to enter the compliance voltage limit value between 0.1000 and 5.0000 V. Press Enter to accept
the new value. Press Escape to restart the setting sequence and enter a different value. Press Escape again to leave the
setting sequence.
4.8 ZERO OUTPUT CURRENT
The Zero Output key on the front panel can be used to set the output current setpoint to 0 A. The current output will
then begin to ramp down using the current ramp rate. This key is equivalent to using the Output Setting key and
entering 0 A. Refer to Paragraph 4.5 to set the output current. There are certain circumstances in which the current will
not be allowed to change, just like when entering a new output current setpoint. An error box will pop up explaining why
the current is not allowed to change. These error boxes are described in Paragraph 4.5
4.9 STOP OUTPUT CURRENT
The Stop Output key will stop the output current ramp within two seconds after the key is pressed even if the magnet is
ramping against the compliance voltage. A new output current setpoint must be entered for the output current to begin
ramping again.
4.10 PAUSE OUTPUT CURRENT
The Pause Output key will pause the output current ramp within two seconds after the key is pressed. While the output
current ramp is paused, the Ramping LED will blink. Pressing the Pause Output key while the output current ramp is
paused will cause the output current ramp to resume ramping to the original output current setpoint.
4.11 MAXIMUM SETTING LIMITS
The Model 625 offers maximum setting limits for output current, compliance voltage limit, and output current ramp rate.
Typically, the properties of the superconducting magnet will dictate what these maximum settings should be. Exceeding
the maximum settings stated by the magnet manufacturer can cause the magnet to quench or be damaged. These
maximum settings should be entered before the magnet system is used to prevent a quench if a setting is incorrectly
entered. Note that the maximum settings will only limit the value when a new setting is entered. For example, if a
maximum ramp rate limit is entered that is less than the present ramp rate, the present ramp rate will not be limited until
a new ramp rate is entered.
4.11.1

Maximum Output Current

The maximum output current limits, in magnitude, the maximum output current that can be entered. This setting will
only limit the internal output current setting. If the output current is being programmed by an external voltage, then some
provision must be made to ensure that the programming voltage will never exceed the desired output current. See
Paragraph 4.18 to setup the External Programming mode.

4.12 RAMP SEGMENTS
Many magnets cannot be charged or discharged at the same rate throughout its entire current capacity. Typically the
magnet cannot be charged as fast when the current in the magnet is high. The Model 625 has a ramp segment feature that
can change the output current ramp rate based on the output current setting. As the output setting ramps through the
segment boundary, the new ramp rate will be used although it will still be limited by the maximum ramp rate setting.
Refer to Paragraph 4.11.3 to set the maximum ramp rate.
To use the ramp segment feature, the ramp segments must be enabled and the ramp segment table must be setup to
specify which ramp rate to use for each current setting. The table should be setup in order of increasing current. A
current entry of 0 A indicates the end of the table and the instrument will not search any higher in the table.
To configure the ramp segments, press Ramp Segments. The first ramp segments setup screen appears as a prompt for

4.13 FIELD CONSTANT
In a superconducting magnet, magnetic field is directly proportional to the current in the magnet. Because of this
relationship, the Model 625 is able to display a calculated field based on a user entered field constant in units of T/A or
kG/A. This value is usually supplied by the magnet manufacturer. In order to display the field reading, the display must
be setup to display in field. Refer to Paragraph 4.4.1 to setup the display mode. Note that the field reading is not an
actual measurement of the magnetic field but an approximation calculated by multiplying the measured output current by
the field constant. To actually measure the magnetic field, an external gaussmeter must be used.
4.13.1

Field Constant Units

The field constant can be entered in either units of T/A or kG/A. This choice not only changes the way the field constant
is entered, but it also chooses the units of the calculated field as well as the output setting units.

Press Enter to accept the new value. Press Escape to restart the setting sequence and enter a different value. Press
Escape again to leave the setting sequence.
4.14 PERSISTENT SWITCH HEATER OUTPUT
Some superconducting magnets are constructed with a persistent switch. A persistent switch is a length of
superconducting wire that shorts across the terminals of the magnet. This length of wire can be heated to drive it into a
resistive state so that a voltage can be applied across the magnet terminals and the magnet can be charged or discharged.
When the heater is shut off, this section of wire will cool and become superconducting again and the magnet will be in
persistent mode. At this time, the power supply can be ramped to zero current and even removed from the system while
the magnet holds its charge. The magnet will continue to hold its charge indefinitely unless the cryogen is allowed to boil
off to the point where there is insufficient cooling to keep the magnet in its superconducting state.

Persistent Switch Heater Delay

When a persistent switch heater is turned on or off, it is in an indeterminate state for a period of time while the switch is
warming or cooling. The persistent switch heater delay should be set to a value that insures that the persistent switch has
fully transitioned from one state to the other. This value is typically not given by the magnet manufacturer but can be
estimated by observation. For most systems, a delay time of 10 to 20 seconds is usually sufficient. During this delay
time, the Model 625 locks out any changes to the output (magnet) current to insure proper operation. The persistent
switch heater delay time can be changed at any time but the new value will not be used until the persistent switch heater
is turned on or off again.
To enter a value for the persistent switch heater delay time, continue from the persistent switch heater current screen or
press PSH Setup then Enter until the following persistent switch setup screen appears as a prompt for the persistent
switch heater delay time.

Use the data entry keys to enter the persistent switch heater delay time between 5 and 100 seconds. Press Enter to accept
the new value. Press Escape to restart the setting sequence and enter a different value. Press Escape again to leave the
setting sequence.
4.14.4

Persistent Mode Ramp Rate

A magnet is said to be in persistent mode when the persistent switch heater is off and the magnet is shorted by the
persistent switch in its superconducting state. While the magnet is in persistent mode, the output current can be ramped
at a faster rate since it is not ramping against the inductance of the magnet. The Model 625 includes the persistent mode
ramp rate feature that will automatically switch to the faster ramp rate when the magnet is in persistent mode. If the
feature is enabled, the persistent mode ramp rate will be used when the magnet is in persistent mode. When the supply is
using this ramp rate, the rate cannot be changed from the front panel using the Ramp Rate key since this is setup under
the PSH Setup key. If the persistent mode ramp rate is disabled, then the ramp rate will remain the same if the magnet is
in persistent mode or not but it can be changed at any time from the front panel using the Ramp Rate key.
To enable the persistent mode ramp rate, continue from the persistent switch delay screen or press PSH Setup then
Enter until the following persistent switch setup screen appears as a prompt for the persistent mode ramp rate.

Operation

Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting MPS User’s Manual

If the persistent mode ramp rate is enabled, then the ramp rate to be used while the magnet is in persistent mode needs to
be entered. Even though this ramp rate is typically much faster than the magnet ramp rate, it should not be set too high as
a fast change in current through the persistent switch can cause the switch to become normal and cause a quench. Note
that the persistent mode ramp rate will not be limited to the maximum ramp rate. Refer to Paragraph 4.11.3 for
information on the maximum ramp rate limit.
To enter a value for the persistent mode ramp rate, continue from the persistent mode ramp rate enable screen or press
PSH Setup then Enter until the following setup screen appears as a prompt for the persistent mode ramp rate.

new value. Press Escape to restart the setting sequence and enter a different value. Press Escape again to leave the
setting sequence.
4.15 PSH ON/OFF
The persistent switch heater should be properly set up before attempting to turn it on. Refer to Paragraph 4.14 to setup
the persistent switch heater. The PSH On and PSH Off buttons will not function unless the persistent switch heater is
enabled. When the PSH is off, no current is sourced to the heater and the persistent switch will revert to its
superconducting state. The magnet is said to be in “persistent mode” and any changes to the output current of the supply
are not reflected in the magnet. When the PSH is on, the persistent switch is heated and becomes resistive. The magnet
current can only be changed when the PSH is on.
To turn on the persistent switch heater, press the PSH On key. The PSH will begin warming and the PSH On LED will
blink. The output current of the power supply cannot be changed while the PSH is in transition. Once the persistent
switch has stabilized, as determined by the PSH delay time, the PSH will be on and the PSH On LED will be on solid.
Refer to Paragraph 4.14.3 to setup the PSH delay time. Note that the PSH cannot be turned on or off while the output
current is ramping or in compliance.
To turn off the persistent switch heater, press the PSH Off key. The PSH will begin cooling and the PSH On LED will
blink. Once the persistent switch has stabilized, the PSH will be off and the PSH On LED will be off.
When turning on the PSH, it is important that the output current setting of the power supply is equal to the current in the
magnet. If the currents are not equal when the PSH is turned on, there is a possibility that the magnet can quench. The
Model 625 adds an extra layer of protection to keep this from happening. The Model 625 stores the output current
setting of the supply when the PSH was turned off last. If the output current setting does not match this stored setting
when the PSH is being turned on, the following message screen will appear.
Cu r r e n t o u t p u t s e t t i n g i s n o t e q u a l t o t h e

La s t Se t p o i n t : + 0 . 0 0 0 0 A
Tu r n o n PSH a n y wa y ? : No
To override the lockout and turn on the PSH anyway, use the s or t key to select Yes and press Enter. This should
only be done if the user is sure that the output current of the power supply matches the current in the magnet. To cancel
this operation, use the s or t key to select No and press Enter or press Escape at any time.
NOTE: If the PSH is turned on when the output current setting does not equal the current in the magnet, the power
supply will ramp the magnet to the output current setting at the compliance voltage limit. It is recommended
that the compliance voltage limit be set to an appropriate value for the magnet before turning on the PSH.

4.16 QUENCH DETECTION
A magnet quenches when a part of the superconducting wire in the magnet becomes resistive. When a section of the
magnet becomes resistive, it will begin to heat and cause more of the magnet to become resistive. This causes an
unstoppable chain reaction that will result in the magnet dissipating all of its energy into heat. There are typically three
ways in which a magnet can quench. One way is if the cryogen is allowed to boil off to the point in which the magnet is
no longer covered. Another way is to ramp the current in the magnet at a rate that is greater than specified. The final way
is to exceed the maximum current specified for the magnet.
Although a magnet quench is undesirable, it typically is non-destructive. Most magnets are designed to be able to handle
dissipating the heat generated with the magnet at rated current. Exceeding the maximum current could cause damage to
the magnet if it were to quench in this state since there is more energy in the system than it was designed for. If a magnet
quench occurs, the level of the cryogen should be checked before operating the magnet system again since much of it
may have boiled off.
Quench detection is important to alert the user and to protect the magnet system. When a quench is detected, the output
current setting of the supply is immediately set to 0 A. If the power supply was still supplying current to the magnet
system after a quench, it is possible that the protection diodes in the magnet would turn on and then the diodes would
take the full current load, destroying themselves in the process. During a quench, the current in the magnet will quickly
drop to zero. The 625 constantly monitors the output current and calculates an actual current ramp rate. If the current
changes at a rate greater than the current step limit then a quench is detected. The current step limit should be set to a
value greater than any expected ramp rate.
4.16.1

Quench Detection Enable

Quench detection can be enabled or disabled. If quench detection is disabled, another form of quench detection should be
used to avoid damage to the magnet system.
To configure quench detection, press Quench Detect. The first quench detection setup screen appears as a prompt for the
quench detection mode.

Use the s or t key to select the quench detection mode, either Enable or Disable. Press Enter to accept the new
selection and continue to the next screen. Press Escape to cancel the new selection and return to the normal display.
4.16.2

Current Step Limit

In order for a quench to be detected, the output current must change at a rate greater than or equal to the current step
limit setting. The current step limit should be set to a rate greater than what the magnet is capable of ramping at if it were
operating correctly. The formula V = L (di/dt) can be used to calculate the maximum ramp rate. For example, the Model
625 has a maximum compliance voltage of 5 V, so for a 10 H magnet, the maximum ramp rate that is possible is 5/10 or
0.5 A/s. The current step limit should be set slightly above the maximum theoretical ramp rate, typically above 0.2 A/s
more. Therefore, a good setting for the current step limit for a 10 H magnet would be about 0.7 A/s.
To enter a value for the current step limit, continue from the quench detection mode screen or press Quench Detect then
Enter until the following quench detection setup screen appears as a prompt for the current step limit value. Quench
detection must be enabled to set the current step limit.

4.18 EXTERNAL CURRENT PROGRAMMING
The output current of the Model 625 can be set internally, externally, or by the sum of the external and internal settings.
Normally, the current is controlled internally by entering a setting from the front panel using the Output Setting key.
Refer to Paragraph 4.5 to set the output current. When the external program mode is set to External, the front panel
setting is fixed at 0 A and the output current is set using an external voltage where 1 V = 10 A. When the external
program mode is set to Sum, the internal and external settings are summed together to set the output current. When using
the External or Sum modes, care must be taken to ensure that the output current does not exceed the maximum current
for the magnet. The software maximum setting limits cannot limit the output current that is set when using the External
or Sum modes. A 40 Hz, low-pass filter limits the bandwidth of the external current programming input. The bandwidth
of the output is also limited by the compliance voltage and the inductance of the magnet. See Paragraph 2.2.2 for a
description of the relationship between voltage and inductance.
To configure the external current program mode press External Program. The following setup screen appears as a
prompt for the external current program mode.

4.19 LOCKING THE KEYPAD
The keypad lock feature prevents accidental changes to parameter values. When the keypad is locked, parameter values
may be viewed but cannot be changed from the front panel. The Model 625 has two keypad lock modes. The lock all
mode locks out changes to all parameters. The lock limits mode locks out changes to all of the parameters except Output
Setting, Ramp Rate, Voltage Limit, Zero Output, Stop Output, Pause Output, PSH On, and PSH Off. This allows the
power supply to be operated without allowing any changes to the power supply setup.
A 3-digit code must be used to lock and unlock the keypad. The factory default code is 123 and it can only be changed
using a computer interface. If the instrument parameters are set to default values, the code is reset to the factory default.
The instrument parameters cannot be reset to default values from the front panel when the keypad is locked.
The following message box appears on the display if the user attempts to change a parameter while the keypad is locked.

CHAPTER 5
COMPUTER INTERFACE OPERATION
5.0 GENERAL
This chapter provides operational instructions for the computer interface for the Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting
Magnet Power Supply. Either of the two computer interfaces provided with the Model 625 permit remote operation. The
first is the IEEE-488 Interface described in Paragraph 5.1. The second is the Serial Interface described in Paragraph 5.2.
The two interfaces share a common set of commands detailed in Paragraph 5.3. Only one interface can be used at a time.
5.1 IEEE-488 INTERFACE
The IEEE-488 Interface is an instrumentation bus with hardware and programming standards that simplify instrument
interfacing. The Model 625 IEEE-488 Interface complies with the IEEE-488.2-1987 standard and incorporates its
functional, electrical, and mechanical specifications unless otherwise specified in this manual.
All instruments on the interface bus perform one or more of the interface functions of TALKER, LISTENER, or BUS
CONTROLLER. A TALKER transmits data onto the bus to other devices. A LISTENER receives data from other
devices through the bus. The BUS CONTROLLER designates to the devices on the bus which function to perform.
The Model 625 performs the functions of TALKER and LISTENER but cannot be a BUS CONTROLLER. The BUS
CONTROLLER is the digital computer which tells the Model 625 which functions to perform.
Below are Model 625 IEEE-488 interface capabilities:
• SH1: Source handshake capability.
• RL1: Complete remote/local capability.
• DC1: Full device clear capability.
• DT1: Complete device trigger capability.
• C0:
No system controller capability.
• T5:
Basic TALKER, serial poll capability, talk only, unaddressed to talk if addressed to listen.
• L4:
Basic LISTENER, unaddressed to listen if addressed to talk.
• SR1: Service request capability.
• AH1: Acceptor handshake capability.
• PP0:
No parallel poll capability.
• E1:
Open collector electronics.
Instruments are connected to the IEEE-488 bus by a 24-conductor connector cable as specified by the standard. Refer to
Paragraph 7.12.2. Cables can be purchased from Lake Shore or other electronic suppliers.
Cable lengths are limited to 2 meters for each device and 20 meters for the entire bus. The Model 625 can drive bus with
up to 10 loads. If more instruments or cable length is required, a bus expander must be used.

5.1.2

Remote/Local Operation

Normal operations from the keypad are referred to as ‘Local’ operations. The Model 625 can also be configured for
‘Remote’ operations via the IEEE-488 interface or the Remote key. The Local key will take the instrument out of
‘Remote’ operation and place it in ‘Local’ operation. During ‘Remote’ operations, the Remote LED annunciator will be
illuminated and operations from the keypad will be disabled.
5.1.3

IEEE-488 Command Structure

The Model 625 supports several command types. These commands are divided into three groups.
1. Bus Control – Refer to Paragraph 5.1.3.1.
a. Universal
(1) Uniline
(2) Multiline
b. Addressed Bus Control
2. Common – Refer to Paragraph 5.1.3.2.
3. Device Specific – Refer to Paragraph 5.1.3.3.
4. Message Strings – Refer to Paragraph 5.1.3.4.

Computer Interface Operation

Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting MPS User’s Manual

5.1.3.1

Bus Control Commands

A Universal Command addresses all devices on the bus. Universal Commands include Uniline and Multiline Commands.
A Uniline Command (Message) asserts only a single signal line. The Model 625 recognizes two of these messages from
the BUS CONTROLLER: Remote (REN) and Interface Clear (IFC). The Model 625 sends one Uniline Command:
Service Request (SRQ).
REN (Remote) – Puts the Model 625 into remote mode.
IFC (Interface Clear) – Stops current operation on the bus.
SRQ (Service Request) – Tells the bus controller that the Model 625 needs interface service.
A Multiline Command asserts a group of signal lines. All devices equipped to implement such commands do so
simultaneously upon command transmission. These commands transmit with the Attention (ATN) line asserted low. The
Model 625 recognizes two Multiline commands:
LLO (Local Lockout) – Prevents the use of instrument front panel controls.
DCL (Device Clear) – Clears Model 625 interface activity and puts it into a bus idle state.
Finally, Addressed Bus Control Commands are Multiline commands that must include the Model 625 listen address
before the instrument responds. Only the addressed device responds to these commands. The Model 625 recognizes four
of the Addressed Bus Control Commands:
SDC (Selective Device Clear) – The SDC command performs essentially the same function as the DCL command
except that only the addressed device responds.
GTL (Go To Local) – The GTL command is used to remove instruments from the remote mode. With some
instruments, GTL also unlocks front panel controls if they were previously locked out with the LLO command.
GET (Group Execute Trigger) – The GET command is used to trigger a device to have its operation started either
individually or as part of a group of devices.
SPE (Serial Poll Enable) and SPD (Serial Poll Disable) – Serial polling accesses the Service Request Status Byte
Register. This status register contains important operational information from the unit requesting service. The SPD
command ends the polling sequence.
5.1.3.2

Common Commands

Common Commands are addressed commands which create commonalty between instruments on the bus. All
instruments that comply with the IEEE-488 1987 standard share these commands and their format. Common commands
all begin with an asterisk. They generally relate to “bus” and “instrument” status and identification. Common query
commands end with a question mark (?). Model 625 common commands are detailed in Paragraph 5.3 and summarized
in Table 5-8.
5.1.3.3

Device Specific Commands

Device specific commands are addressed commands. The Model 625 supports a variety of device specific commands to
program instruments remotely from a digital computer and to transfer measurements to the computer. Most device
specific commands perform functions also performed from the front panel. Model 625 device specific commands are
detailed in Paragraph 5.3 and summarized in Table 5-8.
5.1.3.4

Message Strings

A message string is a group of characters assembled to perform an interface function. There are three types of message
strings: commands, queries and responses. The computer issues command and query strings through user programs, the
instrument issues responses. Two or more command strings or queries can be chained together in one communication but
they must be separated by a semi-colon (;). The total communication string must not exceed 255 characters in length.
A command string is issued by the computer and instructs the instrument to either perform a function or change a
parameter setting. When a command is issued, the computer is acting as ‘talker’ and the instrument as ‘listener’. The
format is:
<command mnemonic><space><parameter data><terminators>.

Computer Interface Operation

5-3

Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting MPS User’s Manual

Command mnemonics and parameter data necessary for each one is described in Paragraph 5.3. Terminators must be
sent with every message string.
A query string is issued by the computer and instructs the instrument which response to send. Queries are issued similar
to commands with the computer acting as ‘talker’ and the instrument as ‘listener’. The query format is:
<query mnemonic><?><space><parameter data><terminators>.
Query mnemonics are often the same as commands with the addition of a question mark. Parameter data is often
unnecessary when sending queries. Query mnemonics and parameter data if necessary is described in Paragraph 5.3.
Terminators must be sent with every message string. Issuing a query does not initiate a response from the instrument.
A response string is sent by the instrument only when it is addressed as a ‘talker’ and the computer becomes the
‘listener’. The instrument will respond only to the last query it receives. The response can be a reading value, status
report or the present value of a parameter. Response data formats are listed along with the associated queries in
Paragraph 5.3.

Status System

5.1.4.1

Overview

The Model 625 implements a status system compliant to the IEEE 488.2 – 1992 standard. The status system provides a
method of recording and reporting instrument information and is typically used to control the Service Request (SRQ)
interrupt line. A diagram of the status system is shown in Figure 5-1. The status system is made up of register sets, the
Status Byte register and the Service Request Enable register. Each register set consists of three types of registers,
condition, event, and enable,
5.1.4.1.1 Condition Registers

Each register set (except the Standard Event Register set) includes a condition register as shown in Figure 5-1. The
condition register constantly monitors the instrument status. The data bits are real-time and are not latched or buffered.
The register is read-only.
5.1.4.1.2 Event Registers

Each register set includes an event register as shown in Figure 5-1. Bits in the event register correspond to various
system events and latch when the event occurs. When an event bit is set, subsequent events corresponding to that bit are
ignored. Set bits remain latched until the register is cleared by a query command (such as *ESR?) or a *CLS command.
The register is read-only.
5.1.4.1.3 Enable Registers

Each register set includes an enable register as shown in Figure 5-1. An enable register determines which bits in the
corresponding event register will set the summary bit for the register set in the Status Byte. The user may write to or read
from an enable register. Each event register bit is logically ANDed to the corresponding enable bit of the enable register.
When an enable register bit is set by the user, and the corresponding bit is set in the event register, the output (summary)
of the register will be set, which in turn sets the summary bit of the Status Byte register.
5.1.4.1.4 Status Byte Register

The Status Byte register, typically referred to as simply the Status Byte, is a non-latching, read-only register that contains
all of the summary bits from the register sets. The status of the summary bits are controlled from the register sets as
explained above. The Status Byte also contains the Request for Service (RQS)/Master Summary Status (MSS) bit. This
bit is used to control the Service Request hardware line on the bus and to report if any of the summary bits are set via the
*STB? command. The status of the RQS/MSS bit is controlled by the summary bits and the Service Request Enable
Register.
5.1.4.1.5 Service Request Enable Register

The Service Request Enable Register determines which summary bits in the Status Byte will set the RQS/MSS bit of the
Status Byte. The user may write to or read from the Service Request Enable Register. Each Status Byte summary bit is
logically ANDed to the corresponding enable bit of the Service Request Enable Register. When a Service Request
Enable Register bit is set by the user, and the corresponding summary bit is set in the Status Byte, the RQS/MSS bit of
the Status Byte will be set, which in turn sets the Service Request hardware line on the bus.

5.1.4.1.6 Reading Registers

Any register in the status system may be read using the appropriate query command. Some registers clear when read,
others do not. Refer to Paragraph 5.1.4.1.7. The response to a query will be a decimal value that corresponds to the
binary-weighted sum of all bits in the register, see Table 5-1. The actual query commands are described later in this
section.

Example: If bits 0, 2, and 4 are set, a query of the register will return a decimal value of 21 (1+4+16).
5.1.4.1.7 Programming Registers

The only registers that may be programmed by the user are the enable registers. All other registers in the status system
are read-only registers. To program an enable register send a decimal value which corresponds to the desired binaryweighted sum of all bits in the register, see Table 5-1. The actual commands are described later in this section.
5.1.4.1.8 Clearing Registers

The methods to clear each register are detailed below.

Status Register Sets

As shown in Figure 5-1, there are five register sets in the status system of the Model 625; Standard Event Status
Register, Operation Event Register, Hardware Error Status Register, Operational Error Status Register, and the Persistent
Switch Error Register.
5.1.4.2.1 Standard Event Status Register Set

The Standard Event Status Register reports the following interface related instrument events: power on detected,
command syntax errors, command execution errors, query errors, operation complete. Any or all of these events may be
reported in the standard event summary bit through the enable register, see Figure 5-2. The Standard Event Status Enable
command (*ESE) programs the enable register and the query command (*ESE?) reads it. *ESR? reads and clears the
Standard Event Status Register. The used bits of the Standard Event Register are described as follows:
Power On (PON), Bit (7) – This bit is set to indicate an instrument off-on transition.
Command Error (CME), Bit (5) – This bit is set if a command error has been detected since the last reading. This
means that the instrument could not interpret the command due to a syntax error, an unrecognized header, unrecognized
terminators, or an unsupported command.
Execution Error (EXE), Bit (4) – This bit is set if an execution error has been detected. This occurs when the
instrument is instructed to do something not within its capabilities.
Query Error (QYE), Bit (2) – This bit indicated a query error. It occurs rarely and involves loss of data because the
output queue is full.
Operation Complete (OPC), Bit (0) – When *OPC is sent, this bit will be set when the instrument has completed all
pending operations. The operation of this bit is not related to the *OPC? command which is a separate interface feature.
Refer to Paragraph 5.1.4.4.6 for more information.

Figure 5-2. Standard Event Status Register
5.1.4.2.2 Operation Event Register Set

The Operation Event Register reports the following instrument events: PSH stable, ramp done, compliance. Any or all of
these events may be reported in the operation event summary bit through the enable register, see Figure 5-4. The
Operation Event Enable command (OPSTE) programs the enable register and the query command (OPSTE?) reads it.
OPSTR? reads and clears the Operation Event Register. OPST? reads the Operation Condition register. The used bits of
the Operation Event Register are described as follows:
PSH Stable, Bit (2) – This bit is set when the persistent switch is stable.
Ramp Done, Bit (1) – This bit is set when the output current ramp is completed.
Compliance, Bit (0) – This bit is set if the output is in compliance limit.

Error Status Register Sets

As shown in Figure 5-1, there are three register sets in the error status system of the Model 625; Hardware Error Status
Register, Operational Error Status Register, and the Persistent Switch Error Register.
5.1.4.3.1 Hardware Error Status Register Set

The Hardware Error Status Register reports the following instrument hardware error events: DAC processor not
responding, output control failure, output over voltage, output over current, low line voltage, temperature fault. Any or
all of these events may be reported in the standard event summary bit through the enable register, see Figure 5-2. The
Hardware Error Status Register is the first value of the three values associated with the Error Status Registers. The Error
Status Enable command (ERSTE) programs the enable register and the query command (ERSTE?) reads it. ERSTR?
reads and clears the Error Status Register. The used bits of the Error Status Event Register are described as follows:
DAC Processor Not Responding (DAC), Bit (5) – This bit is set to indicate that communication to the DAC processor
has failed.
Output Control Failure (OCF), Bit (4) – This bit is set if there is a failure on the output control board.
Output Over Voltage (OOV), Bit (3) – This bit is set if the output voltage exceeded the compliance voltage limit
setting.
Output Over Current (OOC), Bit (2) – This bit is set if the output current is above 62 A exceeding the maximum
output current of the instrument.
Low Line Voltage (LLV), Bit (1) – This bit is set if the power line voltage drops below an acceptable amplitude.
Temperature Fault (TF), Bit (0) – This bit is set if the internal temperature of the instrument exceeded the maximum
safe value of 80 °C.

Figure 5-4. Hardware Error Status Register
5.1.4.3.2 Operational Error Status Register Set

The Operational Error Status Register reports the following instrument operational error events: magnet discharging
through crowbar, magnet quench detected, remote inhibit detected, temperature high, high line voltage, external current
program error, calibration error. Any or all of these events may be reported in the standard event summary bit through
the enable register, see Figure 5-2. The Operational Error Status Register is the second value of the three values
associated with the Error Status Registers. The Error Status Enable command (ERSTE) programs the enable register and
the query command (ERSTE?) reads it. ERSTR? reads and clears the Error Status Register. The used bits of the Error
Status Event Register are described as follows:
Magnet Discharging Through Crowbar (MDC), Bit (6) – This bit is set to indicate that the magnet is currently
discharging through the crowbar. This can happen due to a hardware error or a power loss.
Magnet Quench Detected (QNCH), Bit (5) – This bit is set to indicate that a magnet quench has been detected.
Remote Inhibit Detected (OCF), Bit (4) – This bit is set if the remote inhibit condition has been detected.
Temperature High (OOV), Bit (3) – This bit is set if the internal temperature of the instrument exceeded 75 °C. The
current ramp will be stopped or the compliance voltage will be limited in an attempt to lower the internal temperature.
High Line Voltage (HLV), Bit (2) – This bit is set if the power line voltage exceeds an acceptable amplitude. Operation
can continue but additional heat may be dissipated by the instrument.
External Current Program Error (EPE), Bit (1) – This bit is set if the instrument cannot go into external or sum
current programming modes because the programming voltage is too high.
Calibration Error (CAL), Bit (0) – This bit is set if the instrument is not calibrated or the calibration data has been
corrupted.

Status Register is the third value of the three values associated with the Error Status Registers. The Error Status Enable
command (ERSTE) programs the enable register and the query command (ERSTE?) reads it. ERSTR? reads and clears
the Error Status Register. The used bits of the Error Status Event Register are described as follows:

5.1.4.4

Status Byte and Service Request (SRQ)

As shown in Figure 5-1, the Status Byte Register receives the summary bits from the two status register sets and the
message available summary bit from the output buffer. The status byte is used to generate a service request (SRQ). The
selection of summary bits that will generate an SRQ is controlled by the Service Request Enable Register.
5.1.4.4.1 Status Byte Register

The summary messages from the event registers and output buffer set or clear the summary bits of the Status Byte
Register, see Figure 5-5. These summary bits are not latched. Clearing an event register will clear the corresponding
summary bit in the Status Byte Register. Reading all messages in the output buffer, including any pending queries, will
clear the message available bit. The bits of the Status Byte Register are described as follows:
Operation Summary (OSB), Bit (7) – Set summary bit indicates that an enabled operation event has occurred.
Request Service (RQS)/Master Summary Status (MSS), Bit (6) – This bit is set when a summary bit and the summary
bits corresponding enable bit in the Service Request Enable Register are set. Once set, the user may read and clear the bit
in two different ways, which is why it is referred to as both the RQS and the MSS bit. When this bit goes from low to
high, the Service Request hardware line on the bus is set, this is the RQS function of the bit. See Paragraph 5.1.4.4.3. In
addition, the status of the bit may be read with the *STB? query which returns the binary weighted sum of all bits in the
Status Byte, this is the MSS function of the bit.
Performing a serial poll will automatically clear the RQS function but not the MSS function. A *STB? will read the
status of the MSS bit (along with all of the summary bits), but also will not clear it. To clear the MSS bit, either clear the
event register that set the summary bit or disable the summary bit in the Service Request Enable Register.
Event Summary (ESB), Bit (5) – Set summary bit indicates that an enabled standard event has occurred.
Message Available (MAV), Bit (4) – Set summary bit indicates that a message is available in the output buffer.
Bit (3) – Not used.
Hardware Errors Summary (HESB), Bit (2) – Set summary bit indicates that an enabled hardware error event has
occurred.
Operational Errors Summary (OESB), Bit (1) – Set summary bit indicates that an enabled operational error event has
occurred.
PSH Errors Summary (PESB), Bit (0) – Set summary bit indicates that an enabled persistent switch heater error event
has occurred.
5.1.4.4.2 Service Request Enable Register

The Service Request Enable Register is programmed by the user and determines which summary bits of the Status Byte
may set bit 6 (RQS/MSS) to generate a Service Request. Enable bits are logically ANDed with the corresponding
summary bits, see Figure 5-5. Whenever a summary bit is set by an event register and its corresponding enable bit is set
by the user, bit 6 will set to generate a service request. The Service Request Enable command (*SRE) programs the
Service Request Enable Register and the query command (*SRE?) reads it. Reading the Service Request Enable Register
will not clear it. The register may be cleared by the user by sending *SRE 0.

Figure 5-7. Status Byte Register and Service Request Enable Register
5.1.4.4.3 Using Service Request (SRQ) and Serial Poll

When a Status Byte summary bit (or MAV bit) is enabled by the Service Request Enable Register and goes from 0 to 1,
bit 6 (RQS/MSS) of the status byte will be set. This will send a service request (SRQ) interrupt message to the bus
controller. The user program may then direct the bus controller to serial Poll the instruments on the bus to identify which
one requested service (the one with bit 6 set in its status byte).
Serial polling will automatically clear RQS of the Status Byte Register. This allows subsequent serial polls to monitor bit
6 for an SRQ occurrence generated by other event types. After a serial poll, the same event or any event that uses the
same Status Byte summary bit, will not cause another SRQ unless the event register that caused the first SRQ has been
cleared, typically by a query of the event register.
The serial poll does not clear MSS. The MSS bit stays set until all enabled Status Byte summary bits are cleared,
typically by a query of the associated event register, refer to Paragraph 5.1.4.4.4.
The programming example in Table 5-3 initiates an SRQ when a command error is detected by the instrument.

5.1.4.4.4 Using Status Byte Query (*STB?)

The Status Byte Query (*STB?) command is similar to a Serial Poll except it is processed like any other instrument
command. The *STB? command returns the same result as a Serial Poll except that the Status Byte bit 6 (RQS/MSS) is
not cleared. In this case bit 6 is considered the MSS bit. Using the *STB? command does not clear any bits in the Status
Byte Register.
5.1.4.4.5 Using the Message Available (MAV) bit

Status Byte summary bit 4 (MAV) indicates that data is available to read into your bus controller. This message may be
used to synchronize information exchange with the bus controller. The bus controller can, for example, send a query
command to the Model 625 and then wait for MAV to set. If the MAV bit has been enabled to initiate an SRQ, the user’s
program can direct the bus controller to look for the SRQ leaving the bus available for other use. The MAV bit will be
clear whenever the output buffer is empty.
5.1.4.4.6 Using Operation Complete (*OPC) and Operation Complete Query (*OPC?)

The Operation Complete (*OPC) and Operation Complete Query (*OPC?) are both used to indicate when pending
device operations complete. However, the commands operate with two distinct methods.
The *OPC command is used in conjunction with bit 0 (OPC) of the Standard Event Status Register. If *OPC is sent as
the last command in a command sequence, bit 0 will be set when the instrument completes the operation that was
initiated by the command sequence. Additional commands may be sent between the instrument and the bus controller
while waiting for the initial pending operation to complete. A typical use of this function would be to enable the OPC bit
to generate an SRQ and include the *OPC command when programming the instrument. The bus controller could then
be instructed to look for an SRQ allowing additional communication with the instrument while the initial process
executes.
The *OPC? query has no interaction with bit 0 (OPC) of the Standard Event Status Register. If the *OPC? query is sent
at the end of a command sequence, the bus will be held until the instrument completes the operation that was initiated by
the command sequence. Additional commands (except *RST) should not be sent until the operation is complete as erratic
operation will occur. Once the sequence is complete a 1 will be placed in the output buffer. This function is typically
used to signal a completed operation without monitoring the SRQ. It is also used when it is important to prevent any
additional communication on the bus during a pending operation.

running DOS or in a DOS window. It assumes your IEEE-488 (GPIB) card is installed and operating correctly (refer to
Paragraph 5.1.5.3). Use the following procedure to develop the Serial Interface Program in Quick Basic.
1.

Copy c:\gpib-pc\Qbasic\qbib.obj to the QuickBasic directory (QB4).

2.

Change to the QuickBasic directory and type: link /q qbib.obj,,,bqlb4x.lib; where × = 0 for QB4.0 and 5 for QB4.5
This one-time only command produces the library file qbib.qlb. The procedure is found in the National Instruments
QuickBasic readme file Readme.qb.

3.

Start QuickBasic. Type: qb /l qbib.qlb. Start QuickBasic in this way each time the IEEE interface is used to link in
the library file.

4.

Create the IEEE example interface program in QuickBasic. Enter the program exactly as presented in Table 5-6.
Name the file “ieeeexam.bas” and save.

5.

Run the program.

6.

Type a command query as described in Paragraph 5.1.5.5.

7.

Type “EXIT” to quit the program.

EXAMPLE PROGRAM FOR IEEE-488 INTERFACE

This program works with QuickBasic 4.0/4.5 on an IBM PC or compatible.
The example requires a properly configured National Instruments GPIB-PC2 card. The REM
$INCLUDE statement is necessary along with a correct path to the file QBDECL.BAS.
CONFIG.SYS must call GPIB.COM created by IBCONF.EXE prior to running Basic. There must
be QBIB.QBL library in the QuickBasic Directory and QuickBasic must start with a link
to it. All instrument settings are assumed to be defaults: Address 12, Terminators
<CR> <LF> and EOI active.
To use, type an instrument command or query at the prompt. The computer transmits to
the instrument and displays any response. If no query is sent, the instrument responds
to the last query received. Type "EXIT" to exit the program.

Program Operation

Once either example program is running, try the following commands and observe the response of the instrument. Input
from the user is shown in bold and terminators are added by the program. The word [term] indicates the required
terminators included with the response.
ENTER COMMAND? *IDN?
Identification query. Instrument will return a string identifying itself.
RESPONSE: LSCI,MODEL625,1234567,06122003[term]
ENTER COMMAND? RDGR? 1

Ohm reading query. Instrument will return a string with the present
resistance reading from channel 1.

RESPONSE: +273.150E+00[term]
ENTER COMMAND? HTRRNG 0
ENTER COMMAND? HTRRNG?

Heater range command. Instrument will turn off the heater. No
response will be sent.
Heater range query. Instrument will return a string with the present
heater range setting.

RESPONSE: 0[term]
ENTER COMMAND? HTRRNG 1;HTRRNG? Heater range command followed by a query. Instrument will change to
heater Low setting then return a string
RESPONSE: 1[term]
with the present setting.
The following are additional notes on using either IEEE-488 Interface program.
• If you enter a correctly spelled query without a “?,” nothing will be returned. Incorrectly spelled commands and
queries are ignored. Commands and queries should have a space separating the command and associated parameters.
• Leading zeros and zeros following a decimal point are not needed in a command string, but are sent in response to a
query. A leading “+” is not required but a leading “–” is required.
5.1.6

Troubleshooting

New Installation
1. Check instrument address.
2. Always send terminators.
3. Send entire message string at one time including terminators.
4. Send only one simple command at a time until communication is established.
5. Be sure to spell commands correctly and use proper syntax.
6. Attempt both ‘Talk’ and ‘Listen’ functions. If one works but not the other, the hardware connection is working, so
look at syntax, terminators, and command format.
7. If only one message is received after resetting the interface, check the “repeat addressing” setting. It should be
enabled.
Old Installation No Longer Working
8. Power instrument off then on again to see if it is a soft failure.
9. Power computer off then on again to see if the IEEE card is locked up.
10. Verify that the address has not been changed on the instrument during a memory reset.
11. Check all cable connections.
Intermittent Lockups
12. Check cable connections and length.
13. Increase delay between all commands to 50 ms to make sure instrument is not being over loaded.

5.2 SERIAL INTERFACE OVERVIEW
The serial interface used in the Model 625 is commonly referred to as an RS-232C interface. RS-232C is a standard of
the Electronics Industries Association (EIA) that describes one of the most common interfaces between computers and
electronic equipment. The RS-232C standard is quite flexible and allows many different configurations. However, any
two devices claiming RS-232C compatibility cannot necessarily be plugged together without interface setup. The
remainder of this paragraph briefly describes the key features of a serial interface that are supported by the instrument.
A customer supplied computer with similarly configured interface port is required to enable communication.
5.2.1

Changing Baud Rate

To select the Serial Interface Baud Rate press the Computer Interface key. The first computer interface screen appears
as a prompt for Baud.
Co mp u t e r I n t e r f a c e
Se l e c t Wi t h ° ®
Ba u d : 9 6 0 0
Use the  or  key to select 9600, 19200, 38400, or 57600 Baud. The default is 9600 Baud. Press Enter to accept the
new selection and continue to the next setting screen. Press Escape to cancel the new selection and return to the normal
display.
5.2.2

Physical Connection

The Model 625 has a 9 pin D-Subminiature plug on the rear panel for serial communication. The original RS-232C
standard specifies 25 pins but both 9- and 25-pin connectors are commonly used in the computer industry. Many third
party cables exist for connecting the instrument to computers with either 9- or 25-pin connectors. Paragraph 7.12.1 gives
the most common pin assignments for 9- and 25-pin connectors. Please note that not all pins or functions are supported
by the Model 625.
The instrument serial connector is the plug half of a mating pair and must be matched with a socket on the cable. If a
cable has the correct wiring configuration but also has a plug end, a “gender changer” can be used to mate two plug ends
together.
The letters DTE near the interface connector stand for Data Terminal Equipment and indicate the pin connection of the
directional pins such as transmit data (TD) and receive data (RD). Equipment with Data Communications Equipment
(DCE) wiring can be connected to the instrument with a straight through cable. As an example, Pin 3 of the DTE
connector holds the transmit line and Pin 3 of the DCE connector holds the receive line so the functions complement.
It is likely both pieces of equipment are wired in the DTE configuration. In this case Pin 3 on one DTE connector (used
for transmit) must be wired to Pin 2 on the other (used for receive). Cables that swap the complementing lines are called
null modem cables and must be used between two DTE wired devices. Null modem adapters are also available for use
with straight through cables. Paragraph 7.12.1 illustrates suggested cables that can be used between the instrument and
common computers.
The instrument uses drivers to generate the transmission voltage levels required by the RS-232C standard. These
voltages are considered safe under normal operating conditions because of their relatively low voltage and current limits.
The drivers are designed to work with cables up to 50 feet in length.

5.2.3

Hardware Support

The Model 625 interface hardware supports the following features. Asynchronous timing is used for the individual bit
data within a character. This timing requires start and stop bits as part of each character so the transmitter and receiver
can resynchronize between each character. Half duplex transmission allows the instrument to be either a transmitter or a
receiver of data but not at the same time. Communication speeds of 9600, 19200, 38400, or 57600 Baud are supported.
The Baud rate is the only interface parameter that can be changed by the user.
Hardware handshaking is not supported by the instrument. Handshaking is often used to guarantee that data message
strings do not collide and that no data is transmitted before the receiver is ready. In this instrument, appropriate software
timing substitutes for hardware handshaking. User programs must take full responsibility for flow control and timing as
described in Paragraph 5.2.6.
5.2.4

Character Format

A character is the smallest piece of information that can be transmitted by the interface. Each character is 10 bits long
and contains data bits, bits for character timing and an error detection bit. The instrument uses 7 bits for data in the
ASCII format. One start bit and one stop bit are necessary to synchronize consecutive characters. Parity is a method of
error detection. One parity bit configured for odd parity is included in each character.
ASCII letter and number characters are used most often as character data. Punctuation characters are used as delimiters
to separate different commands or pieces of data. Two special ASCII characters, carriage return (CR 0DH) and line feed
(LF 0AH), are used to indicate the end of a message string.

Message Strings

A message string is a group of characters assembled to perform an interface function. There are three types of message
strings commands, queries and responses. The computer issues command and query strings through user programs, the
instrument issues responses. Two or more command or query strings can be chained together in one communication but
they must be separated by a semi-colon (;). The total communication string must not exceed 255 characters in length.
A command string is issued by the computer and instructs the instrument to perform a function or change a parameter
setting. The format is:
<command mnemonic><space><parameter data><terminators>.
Command mnemonics and parameter data necessary for each one is described in Paragraph 5.3. Terminators must be
sent with every message string.

Computer Interface Operation

5-25

Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting MPS User’s Manual

Message Strings (Continued)

A query string is issued by the computer and instructs the instrument to send a response. The query format is:
<query mnemonic><?><space><parameter data><terminators>.
Query mnemonics are often the same as commands with the addition of a question mark. Parameter data is often
unnecessary when sending queries. Query mnemonics and parameter data if necessary is described in Paragraph 5.3.
Terminators must be sent with every message string. The computer should expect a response very soon after a query is
sent.
A response string is the instruments response or answer to a query string. The instrument will respond to the last query or
queries it receives. The response can be a reading value, status report or the present value of a parameter. Response data
formats are listed along with the associated queries in Paragraph 5.3. The response is sent as soon as possible after the
instrument receives the query. Typically, it takes 10 ms for the instrument to begin the response. Some responses take
longer.
5.2.6

Message Flow Control

It is important to remember that the user program is in charge of the serial communication at all times. The instrument
cannot initiate communication, determine which device should be transmitting at a given time or guarantee timing
between messages. All of this is the responsibility of the user program.
When issuing commands only the user program should:
• Properly format and transmit the command including terminators as one string.
• Guarantee that no other communication is started for 50 ms after the last character is transmitted.
• Not initiate communication more than 20 times per second.
When issuing queries or queries and commands together the user program should:
• Properly format and transmit the query including terminators as one string.
• Prepare to receive a response immediately.
• Receive the entire response from the instrument including the terminators.
• Guarantee that no other communication is started during the response or for 50 ms after it completes.
• Not initiate communication more than 20 times per second.
Failure to follow these simple rules will result in inability to establish communication with the instrument or intermittent
failures in communication.
5.2.7

Serial Interface Example Programs

Two BASIC programs are included to illustrate the serial communication functions of the instrument. The first program
was written in Visual Basic. Refer to Paragraph 5.2.7.1 for instructions on how to setup the program. The Visual Basic
code is provided in Table 5-9. The second program was written in Quick Basic. Refer to Paragraph 5.2.7.2 for
instructions on how to setup the program. The Quick Basic code is provided in Table 5-10. Finally, a description of
operation common to both programs is provided in Paragraph 5.2.7.3. While the hardware and software required to
produce and implement these programs not included with the instrument, the concepts illustrated apply to almost any
application where these tools are available.

Lake Shore Model 625 Superconducting MPS User’s Manual

The error messages are divided into two groups. Instrument hardware errors are related to the instruments internal
circuits. When one of these errors occurs, the output crowbar SCR will be thrown, the Fault LED will be lit and there
will be no way to clear the error unless power is cycled. If one of these error messages persist after power is cycled, the
instrument requires repair. Instrument hardware errors are listed in Table 7-1. Operational errors are related to instrument
operation and do not necessarily indicate a hardware problem. When one of theses errors occurs, the Fault LED will be
blinking and the error condition can be cleared once the fault condition has been removed. Operational errors are listed in
Table 7-2.

zero. This error can be cleared when the remote inhibit trigger is released.
The internal temperature of the supply has exceeded 75 °C. If the output current is
increasing, the output current ramp will stop. If the output current is decreasing,
the compliance voltage will be limited to 1 V. This error can be cleared when the
internal temperature drops below 70 °C.
The input line voltage is detected to be too high. This error can be cleared when
the input line voltage is within specified tolerances.
The instrument was not allowed to change to external or sum current
programming modes because the programming voltage is greater than 0.025 V.
This error can be cleared when the programming voltage is less than 0.025 V or
the instrument is changed to internal current programming mode.
The instrument has either not been calibrated or the calibration data has been
corrupted. The error can be cleared at any time and the instrument can still be used
but there is no guarantee that it is operating within specifications. The instrument
needs to be recalibrated to correct this error condition.
The persistent switch heater circuitry has detected a short and the heater has been
shut off. This error can be cleared at any time and will be checked again when the
heater is turned back on.
The persistent switch heater circuitry has detected an open circuit and the heater
has been shut off. This error can be cleared at any time and will be checked again
when the heater is turned back on.

7.7 OUTPUT SOURCE IMPEDANCE
The current output of the Model 625 has a 25 Ω source impedance, resulting from a 25 Ω resistor across the output
terminals. This is necessary to keep the output of the power supply stable into the purely inductive load of a
superconducting magnet. This is common practice in many superconducting magnet power supplies. This typically
results in negligible error when driving a superconducting load. The displayed output current is compensated for the
current loss through the resistor and reflects the actual current in the magnet.
This impedance can cause unexpected results in systems that have larger than normal lead resistance or other resistive
impedance. If there is a voltage across the output terminals of the supply, then a small amount of current will flow
through the stabilizing resistor given by the equation I = V/25, where I is the current through the resistor and V is the
voltage across the output terminals. This will reduce the amount of current flowing through the magnet. The output
current reading is compensated for the current flowing through the resistor and is representative of the current in the
magnet. If it is necessary to have the current in the magnet exactly equal a certain value, the output current setting can be
increased until the output current reading is equal to the desired amount.
In some circumstances, it may be desirable to disable the reading compensation. In this case, the output current reading
will closely match the output current setting, but the reading may not be indicative of the current in the magnet since the
current in the resistor is not accounted for. To disable the reading compensation of the source impedance, send
CALCOMP 1 over the computer interface. To turn on the reading compensation, the default setting, send CALCOMP 0
over the interface. To make the change nonvolatile, send the CALSAVE command after setting the compensation or else
the previous setting will be used at the next power up.
There are some magnet systems in which the 25 Ω output resistor is not necessary for stable operation. Many of the
magnets that have a persistent switch have enough resistance for the power supply to operate properly. In this case, the
resistor can be removed and the reading compensation shut off in software. Please contact Lake Shore for further
information on removing this resistor.
CAUTION: If the 25 Ω output resistor is removed and the power supply is operated on a magnet without enough
resistance, the power supply can go into oscillation possibly quenching and damaging the magnet.
Please contact Lake Shore before attempting this procedure.
7.8 ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE
Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) may damage electronic parts, assemblies, and equipment. ESD is a transfer of electrostatic
charge between bodies at different electrostatic potentials caused by direct contact or induced by an electrostatic field.
The low-energy source that most commonly destroys Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive (ESDS) devices is the human
body, which generates and retains static electricity. Simply walking across a carpet in low humidity may generate up to
35,000 volts of static electricity.
Current technology trends toward greater complexity, increased packaging density, and thinner dielectrics between
active elements, which results in electronic devices with even more ESD sensitivity. Some electronic parts are more
ESDS than others. ESD levels of only a few hundred volts may damage electronic components such as semiconductors,
thick and thin film resistors, and piezoelectric crystals during testing, handling, repair, or assembly. Discharge voltages
below 4000 volts cannot be seen, felt, or heard.

3.
4.
5.

6.

De-energize or disconnect all power and signal sources and loads used with unit.
Place unit on a grounded conductive work surface.
Ground technician through a conductive wrist strap (or other device) using 1 MΩ series resistor to protect operator.
Ground any tools, such as soldering equipment, that will contact unit. Contact with operator's hands provides a
sufficient ground for tools that are otherwise electrically isolated.
Place ESDS devices and assemblies removed from a unit on a conductive work surface or in a conductive container.
An operator inserting or removing a device or assembly from a container must maintain contact with a conductive
portion of the container. Use only plastic bags approved for storage of ESD material.
Do not handle ESDS devices unnecessarily or remove from the packages until actually used or tested.

7.13 CALIBRATION
Lake Shore maintains a fully automated calibration fixture for the Model 625 that measures existing performance of the
unit and then recalibrates the using NIST traceable resistance and voltage standards. In addition, non-calibration features
are verified for proper operation by a full battery of extensive tests. Although this testing is very complete, it requires the
return of the Model 625 to Lake Shore to perform the recalibration. In some instances, however, it may be necessary to
recalibrate the Model 625 in the field. Calibration information for the following operating parameters is provided:
•
•
•
•
•

Output Current.
Output Current Reading.
Output Voltage Reading.
Remote Voltage Reading.
External Programming Voltage.

These calibrations are done through the computer interface and the calibration constants are stored in the non-volatile
memory in the instrument. There are no trim-pots inside the Model 625 and the cover does not have to be removed to
calibrate the instrument. The remaining features of the Model 625 do not require calibration to operate within their
specified tolerances.
7.13.1

Calibration Interface

Computer interface commands are included in the Model 625 specifically for calibration. These commands work with
either the IEEE-488 or RS-232C interface. Refer to Section 7.13.4 for a complete description of each calibration
command.
It is always recommended to read out old calibration coefficients using the CALZ? and CALG? interface queries before
attempting to calibrate. This will give the operator experience with the interface command, data formatting, and typical
values. If the old values are saved, they can be reloaded in the case of accidental loss of data during calibration. New
calculated calibration coefficients should be very similar to the old values. Discrepancy between the old and new values
of more than 0.1% of gain calibration coefficients or 0.1% of range for zero coefficients could indicate an error in the
calibration procedure or a hardware failure. Do not attempt to recalibrate a damaged instrument.
The instrument will use the new calibration coefficients as soon as they are sent with the either the CALZ or CALG
interface command but they are not saved permanently until the CALSAVE command is issued. If a mistake is made in
the calibration process, turn the instrument power off and on again before CALSAVE is issued to restore the old
calibration constants. Once CALSAVE is issued, old values cannot be retrieved from the instrument.
If calibration coefficients are left at default or are outside of the normal calibration range, the following error message
will appear in the instrument display when the instrument is turned on: “Instrument Uncalibrated”. This error message
must be bypassed to allow calibration of the instrument. Press both Enter and Escape keys simultaneously to bypass the
error message. Operation in this state is possible but at least one calibration is known to be out of proper range and
measurement is likely to be erroneous.
Simple communications program examples are shown in Sections 5.2.7.1 and 5.2.7.2. Some time should be spent
becoming familiar with the calibration commands before beginning a calibration. Although the calibration factors are
sent to the Model 625 over the computer interface, this procedure is written to obtain the Model 625 readings solely by
visual observation of the front panel.

Calibration Equipment

Shunt Resistor. The output current of the Model 625 must be measured externally as the primary reference for
calibration. When current is measured, it is the result of the current through the known resistance of the calibration
resistor. This resistor must be accurately measured and its actual value (R Shunt) used to determine the actual
current flow. For example, if the resistor is measured at 0.99661 mΩ, the actual current flowing is calculated by
Equation 1.

This resistor must withstand the full current of the Model 625 and do so with a minimum of heating that can easily
change the resistance and therefore the current measurement. At 60 A, this resistor only dissipates 3.6 W. Even so, it
is highly recommended to mount the resistor on a heat sink with forced air-cooling to minimize temperature rise.
(Alpha PSBWR0010F is suggested)
2.

Load Resistor. This resistor is placed in series with the 1 mΩ resistor to create a compliance voltage to calibrate the
voltage reading of the Model 625. This resistor value should be in a range from 0.075 Ω to 5 Ω. The actual value of
this resistor is not critical since only a voltage measurement is made to calibrate a voltage reading on the Model 625.
To determine the amount of power the resistor will be required to handle, reference the formula in Section 7.13.3.8
step 4. This specifies the amount of current through the resistor. Note the output voltage is compliance limited to
5 V. For example, a 0.075 Ω resistor will develop 270 W and a 5 Ω resistor will develop 5 W.

3.

PSH Resistor. This is simply a 1 W, 100 Ω resistor used to develop a voltage from the PSH output current to drive
the Analog Current Programming Input for its gain calibration. During the procedure, this resistor will dissipate only
0.25 W.

4.

DC Voltmeter (DVM). The voltmeter must measure VDC accurately to 10’s of µV if resolution to 10’s of mA
(from the Model 625) is to be assured. The HP34401 or better is suggested.

7.13.3.6

Calibrate Output Current Gain (Span)

This calibration is the most difficult and most important of the procedure. It first requires measuring the span of the trim
range (which changes from unit to unit within 1 – 2%) to determine the trim adjustment range that corresponds to a 100%
calibration trim change. In other words, we adjust the calibration in % from –100% to +100% but the size of the
calibration trim range changes slightly for each unit. We first measure the span of the calibration trim range and then
measure the full span of the instrument with the calibration trim set to 0%. We have adopted the use of % as the unit
name for the trim calibration since it corresponds to only the percent of trim range and not the full span of the
instrument.
The 55 A set point for calibration is chosen because the maximum trim range at 60 A forces the current past the 61 A
internal analog limit and therefore creates significant error. Yet another source of lesser error is the 25 Ω parallel
damping resistor that is part of the output circuitry of the Model 625. While at a 0 volt output, this resistance contributes
no error but when there is voltage created by the current, this error becomes significant. Even though small, wiring
resistance may allow the voltage across the output terminals of the Model 625 to reach 0.5 V or so at 55 A depending
upon length. This reduces the measured shunt current by 0.5 V/25 Ω or 0.020 A and therefore, must be considered during
the calibration. The shunt resistor remains connected to the output terminals for this procedure.

Gaussian units and cgs emu are the same for magnetic properties. The defining relation is B = H + 4πM.
Multiply a number in Gaussian units by C to convert it to SI (e.g. 1 G × 10-4T/G = 10-4T).
SI (Système International d'Unités) has been adopted by the National Bureau of Standards. Where two conversion factors are given, the upper one is
recognized under, or consistent with, SI and is based on the definition B = µ0(H + M), where to µ0 = 4π × 10-7H/m. The lower one is not recognized under SI
and is based on the definition B = µ0H + J, where the symbol I is often used in place of J.

APPENDIX C
HANDLING LIQUID HELIUM AND NITROGEN
C1.0 GENERAL
Use of liquid helium (LHe) and liquid nitrogen (LN2) is often associated with the Model 625 Superconducting MPS.
Although not explosive, there are a number of safety considerations to keep in mind in the handling of LHe and LN2.
C2.0 PROPERTIES
LHe and LN2 are colorless, odorless, and tasteless gases. Gaseous nitrogen makes up about 78 percent of the Earth’s
atmosphere, while helium comprises only about 5 ppm. Most helium is recovered from natural gas deposits. Once
collected and isolated, the gases will liquefy when properly cooled. A quick comparison between LHe and LN2 is
provided in Table C-1.

C3.0 HANDLING CRYOGENIC STORAGE DEWARS
Cryogenic containers (Dewars) must be operated in accordance with manufacturer instructions. Safety instructions will
also be posted on the side of each Dewar. Cryogenic Dewars must be kept in a well-ventilated place where they are
protected from the weather and away from any sources of heat. A typical cryogenic Dewar is shown in Figure C-1.

C4.0 LIQUID HELIUM AND NITROGEN SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
Transferring LHe and LN2 and operation of the storage Dewar controls should be in accordance with the
manufacturer/supplier’s instructions. During this transfer, it is important that all safety precautions written on the storage
Dewar and recommended by the manufacturer be followed.
WARNING: Liquid helium and liquid nitrogen are potential asphyxiants and can cause rapid suffocation without
warning. Store and use in area with adequate ventilation. DO NOT vent container in confined spaces.
DO NOT enter confined spaces where gas may be present unless area has been well ventilated. If
inhaled, remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give
oxygen. Get medical help.
WARNING: Liquid helium and liquid nitrogen can cause severe frostbite to the eyes or skin. DO NOT touch
frosted pipes or valves. In case of frostbite, consult a physician at once. If a physician is not readily
available, warm the affected areas with water that is near body temperature.
The two most important safety aspects to consider when handling LHe and LN2 are adequate ventilation and eye and
skin protection. Although helium and nitrogen gases are non-toxic, they are dangerous in that they replace the air in a
normal breathing atmosphere. Liquid products are of an even greater threat since a small amount of liquid evaporates to
create a large amount of gas. Therefore, it is imperative that cryogenic Dewars be stored and the cryogenic system be
operated in open and well ventilated areas.
Persons transferring LHe and LN2 should make every effort to protect eyes and skin from accidental contact with liquid
or the cold gas issuing from it. Protect your eyes with full face shield or chemical splash goggles. Safety glasses (even
with side shields) are not adequate. Always wear special cryogenic gloves (Tempshield Cryo-Gloves® or equivalent)
when handling anything that is, or may have been, in contact with the liquid or cold gas, or with cold pipes or equipment.
Long sleeve shirts and cuffless trousers that are of sufficient length to prevent liquid from entering the shoes are
recommended.
C5.0 RECOMMENDED FIRST AID
Every site that stores and uses LHe and LN2 should have an appropriate Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) present. The
MSDS may be obtained from the manufacturer/distributor. The MSDS will specify the symptoms of overexposure and
the first aid to be used. A typical summary of these instructions is provided as follows.
If symptoms of asphyxia such as headache, drowsiness, dizziness, excitation, excess salivation, vomiting, or
unconsciousness are observed, remove the victim to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. If breathing has
stopped, give artificial respiration. Call a physician immediately.
If exposure to cryogenic liquids or cold gases occurs, restore tissue to normal body temperature (98.6°F) as rapidly as
possible, then protect the injured tissue from further damage and infection. Call a physician immediately. Rapid warming
of the affected parts is best achieved by bathing it in warm water. The water temperature should not exceed 105 °F
(40 °C), and under no circumstances should the frozen part be rubbed, either before or after rewarming. If the eyes are
involved, flush them thoroughly with warm water for at least 15 minutes. In case of massive exposure, remove clothing
while showering with warm water. The patient should not drink alcohol or smoke. Keep warm and rest. Call a physician
immediately.
